Throughout history God has called His people to follow Him. That divine mandate to leave all and follow Him is the very crux of the Gospels. God does not need decision-makers-He needs hearers. He is looking for those who will hear His voice and respond, following Him even to the uttermost parts of the earth. 

Moses did not make his own decisions concerning the building of the tabernacle but \"proceeded to do everything as the Lord had commanded him\" (Exodus 40:16). In all the travels of the Israelites, they followed the cloud as instructed, never moving unless the cloud moved (v. 36-37). It was not their place to determine when to move or where to go.  They were totally dependent on God's guidance. 

After He was baptized in the Jordan, \"immediately the Holy Spirit compelled Jesus to go into the wilderness\" (Mark 1:12). Without questioning or hesitating, Jesus followed the Spirit and went into a most unlikely place. In the same way, many times your mind cannot comprehend the directions of God, but you can be led of Him by your spirit, for you are the temple of the Holy Spirit. 

Paul said, \"For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God\" (Romans 8:14). The cloud of God is no longer above you, but within you! Wait for the \"cloud of peace\" before moving in any direction. Don't make a hasty decision, but simply purpose from this day forward to follow the Lamb wherever He goes (Revelation 14:4).

Jesus was busy for God. His days were filled with divine activity in healing the sick, driving out demons, and preaching the Gospel. Throughout His hectic schedule, however, there remained one constant: fellowship with God. Such fellowship was the secret of Jesus' power in ministry. 

You must not get more interested in the work of God than in the God of the work! Spending time with God provides a continual recharging of your spiritual battery. As you fellowship with Him, you are able to both listen to His direction and continually enjoy His presence. 

In Leviticus 3:1 Moses spoke of the peace offering. This was an offering given to the Lord simply to express worship and love for Him. After Jesus had spent time alone in worship and prayer to the Father, He knew the direction He was to take and shared it with His disciples: \"We must go on to other towns as well, and I will preach to them, too, because that is why I came\" (Mark 1:38). 

As you draw away to express your love for the Lord in that secret place of prayer, the Lord will show you the next move for your life. So draw aside from the world, climb the hill of God every morning, and be refreshed, redirected, and refired!

Guilt does not simply go away. The modern method of denying guilt just postpones it until a later day. Repressed and denied guilt will always resurface in the form of anger, bitterness, rejection, and failure. 

God knows how unforgiven sin will destroy you and your relationship with Him and others. In the Old Testament, He gave instructions for the guilt offering that related to any situation, whether it was the high priest, a leader, an individual, or the entire community that had sinned. The only way to be forgiven in the Old Testament system was to bring an individual sacrifice. Worshipers brought a bull, a goat, a lamb, two pigeons, or a handful of fine flour, depending upon their status and means. No sin or negligence was swept under the rug by God but was paid for by something. 

Sinners are Jesus' specialty. The Bible tells us that not only is God precise with sin, but He is also merciful toward sinners. Take Levi, for example. Jesus accepted Levi's invitation to dine with him and his friends, who were notorious sinners. When the Pharisees discovered this, they criticized the Lord. Jesus responded, \"I have come to call sinners, not those who think they are already good enough\" 

(Mark 2:17). 

Jesus is your \"guilt offering.\" Release your guilt to the cross and praise Him, knowing that you were once a sinner but now have been forgiven.

Handling opposition is difficult, especially if the opposition is from those you love. Jesus faced opposition continually, even from those in His own family who said, \"He's out of his mind\" (Mark 3:21). In addition, Jesus also faced opposition from the teachers of the Law who remarked, \"He's possessed by Satan\" (v. 22). 

David gave the best prescription for handling opposition. First, he said to trust in the Lord. Never believe that a problem is yours. Just relax as a baby would in the arms of its mother. 

Second, David said to delight in the Lord. Keep your focus on the delightful relationship between you and your God. Never let the devil steal your joy and the sense that all is well. 

Third, he said to \"commit everything you do to the Lord\" (Psalm 37:5). Commit means \"to roll.\" Just shift the weight of opposition from your shoulders onto the shoulders of God. He is more than able to carry it. 

Finally, David said in verse 7 of Psalm 37 to \"be still.\" How quickly we want to take matters into our own hands and begin to \"fight fire with fire\"! We've got to learn, however, to discipline ourselves to wait on the Lord to fight the battle for us. 

Trust, delight, commit, and be still, and in the end you will see that the battle belongs to the Lord.

Harvest is a time of high motivation, a time when all the efforts of an entire year come to fruition. How can someone sleep if the grain is standing ready and a storm is coming that can ruin it? If people sleep, they are wasting the blood, sweat, and tears of all the laborers before them. They are turning their backs on the financial rewards the harvest will bring at the market. They are wasting their day of opportunity. 

Jesus spoke of those who receive the Word but are distracted by lives of ease and pleasure. Although the harvest is ripe, they are busy pursuing the things of this world. He reminded us that others, however, would be wise sons or daughters who would gather thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold in the day of harvest (Mark 4:20). 

We are now in the period of the greatest spiritual harvest the world has ever seen. Hundreds of thousands of new Christians are being saved every day. Lay aside your sleep and wake up! Your summer of harvest may never happen again this side of eternity.

The command of faith in the mouth of Jesus was astounding. With two words, an entire storm broke, and the violence of death was stilled. The Word of God in your mouth is the most powerful force in the world. Paul said, \"The message is close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart\" (Romans 10:8). 

Jesus is the Word; therefore, when you speak the Word, you are speaking Jesus into your situation. Faith consists of first believing in your heart that God's Word is true and then speaking that Word to your circumstances and watching them change. 

When Jesus spoke the command of faith to the legion of demons, they had no choice but to obey (Mark 5:13). The centurion, too, understood this principle and told the Lord that all that was needed was a simple command from His mouth for his servant to be healed (Matthew 8:8-9). 

Joshua spoke to the sun, Jesus spoke to the fig tree, and you can speak to your storms. Expect the Word of God in your mouth to move mountains!

The Master made no conscious decision to heal the woman with the issue of blood mentioned in this passage. Her faith had decided that Christ was the Source of all healing and that God was no respecter of persons. She believed she could tap into that well of life by faith. 

Healing must be received, like a radio receives radio waves. Christ is our Healer, but we must be tenacious and unwavering in our perseverance to receive the healing we need. Someone has said that faith is like a fuse. A fuse is tiny and unassuming, having no power in itself except to complete a circuit so power can flow. The fuse only works with low resistance; otherwise, it will blow! In the same way, Christ is the mighty Generator of the power of God, and we need only keep our little \"fuses of faith\" in the line. 

When the report of his daughter's death reached his ears, Jairus, like the woman with the issue of blood, kept his \"faith fuse\" from blowing. He refused to allow fear to blow his fuse and short-circuit his miracle (Mark 5:36).

Sin is a spiritual disease that has strong parallels to leprosy in the natural world. In biblical days, leprosy was a progressive, incurable, contagious disease. It was extremely dangerous to the person afflicted even if only a small area was affected. 

Why would the Law pronounce a person who had become covered in the disease to be clean? Charles Spurgeon pointed out leprosy's striking parallel to the consciousness of sin. When we think we have only a spot of sin, we are unclean, but when we realize that we are totally consumed by sin, we can be made clean! God wants us to understand that our own self-righteousness is as \"filthy rags\" (Isaiah 64:6). Only as we abandon our claim to being anything good before God can He come in as our great High Priest and make us clean. 

Pity those who feel they only need God as a \"Band-Aid\" on their sin and don't comprehend that they are totally consumed by the dreaded disease. Come to Jesus repentant, helpless, and hopeless. He will make His eternal pronouncement: You are clean!

No book could contain the volume of miraculous events that took place during the ministry of Jesus. \"Wherever he went . . . they laid the sick in the market plazas and streets. The sick begged him to let them at least touch the fringe of his robe, and all who touched it were healed\" 

(Mark 6:56). Masses of suffering human beings were carried, laid by the road, and pressed closely to the Master in hopes of receiving just one healing touch. Not one was refused or turned away. Every person who was willing to press in and touch Him received a miracle. 

Today, remarkably, more and more miracles are occurring on a worldwide scale. Every day on every continent of the world, thousands receive miraculous healings and deliverances in the name of Jesus.

Unclean was the word the Pharisees most feared. They spent hours washing pots, spots, and dots! They followed and amplified to impossible proportions every little hygienic requirement of the Mosaic Law. Jesus answered the objections of the Pharisees by pointing out that unclean refers more to a state of the heart than to a state of the hands. 

Bad attitudes, anger, adulteries, and arrogance cannot be removed from the human heart by any amount of hand washing. Unlike unclean foods that are simply processed through the body and the wastes removed naturally, unclean attitudes sit like poison in the human spirit and wait to spring into actions. 

Aaron learned the mystery of cleansing before God: \"Then he must dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle it seven times over the altar. In this way, he will cleanse it from Israel's defilement and return it to its former holiness\" (Leviticus 16:19). Water may cleanse the body, but only blood can cleanse the spirit!

Jesus sighed. This word is used to describe a groan drawn from deep within. Before a miracle occurs, the Holy Spirit must groan, or pray from within us. Romans 8:26 tells us that we do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. That groaning, or inner compassion of the Spirit, always comes right before the works of God are revealed. 

Jesus said, \"Ephphatha!\" (Mark 7:34 KJV), which is an Aramaic word describing the loosing of an entire person, not just a part. Satan had kept this man in bondage, and Christ was commanding him to \"be loosed!\" The string (or in the Greek, \"bondage\") of his tongue was immediately loosed. The process included groaning, commanding, and then loosing! 

This is the work of the Church. We are to be so filled with the Holy Spirit that we feel the needs of the poor (Psalm 41:1) and command them to \"be loosed!\" Ask the Holy Spirit to pray through you for the needs of those in bondage. Satan must loose them because we are of the company of \"Ephphatha!\"

As one of the two great commandments Jesus quoted from the Old Testament, this rule consists of five simple words that embody everything else: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" For New Testament believers, the Holy Spirit automatically teaches their hearts to do all that relates to this commandment. But for those who were under the Law, God had to spell out exactly how they should behave. 

Leviticus 19 tells us that God instructed His people to be generous (vv. 9-10) and to leave something in the fields for the poor. He commanded them not to steal, lie, or deceive one another (vv. 11-13). He told them to respect the helpless (v. 14) and not to take advantage of them. He directed them to judge their neighbors fairly, not showing favoritism (v. 15). Finally, He told them not to slander, harbor hatred, or seek revenge (vv. 16-18). As simple as these commandments sound, they gave practical steps to the admonition to \"love your neighbor.\" 

Love is the fulfilling of the Law and the highest of God's commandments. In all your relationships, apply this \"royal command\" (James 2:8). God will bless you, and others will love you in return!

The requirements for the priesthood were extremely high. Priests were separated unto God and restricted as to whom they could marry because they had \"been made holy by the anointing oil of . . . God\" (Leviticus 21:12). The high priest could not even touch a dead body or mourn for a dead parent. His emotions, priorities, and focus were restricted by his walk in the anointing. 

Walking away from sin is not a difficult choice for those of us who understand how precious is the anointing of the Holy Spirit. We cannot walk, touch, and marry as we choose. We willingly restrict our lives in order to avoid grieving the Holy Spirit of God. Others may be able to compromise their lifestyles with seemingly no penalty, but our choices all center on keeping His anointing. We are totally devoted unto God. Our lives are our ministries, and our callings are our priorities. 

On the Mount of Transfiguration, Christ's anointing shone through His very garments (Mark 9:3). So strong was the anointing that demons ran when confronted with it (v. 26). Is it worthwhile to desire that kind of anointing? Absolutely! Receive it, walk in it, and minister in it. Nothing in life is as precious as the anointing.

Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles were the three Jewish calendar feasts. Passover exemplifies our salvation, for Passover is the time when we remember how the blood of Jesus has been applied to the doorposts of our hearts. Pentecost, the day when the firstfruits were reaped, represents our baptism in the Holy Spirit. The Feast of Tabernacles, a seven-day celebration of the completion of Solomon's temple, depicts a futuristic, eternal celebration of the completion of harvest. 

Heaven will be the place of celebration at the completion of the heavenly temple, at the final ingathering of the harvest. Heaven is the place where Christ's victory over Satan will be celebrated forever. Heaven will be an eternal camp meeting where cares are left behind, total rest and refreshing are continual, and joy is unbridled. Throughout the long year of labor, let us anticipate the final feast at the end of time. In that day, our labors will be over, and God will be our entire reward.

Money is a central heart issue in the Gospel. The rich young ruler mentioned in the book of Mark made a profession of faith, but his money did not follow. Promises of love and discipleship to Jesus are empty unless your possessions mean nothing compared to Him. The way a person uses money is always a reflection of what's in his heart. If Jesus had occupied first place in the rich young ruler's heart, it would have been evidenced in his attitude toward his money. 

In Leviticus 25 the principle of the Sabbath year brought up an issue similar to the story of the rich young ruler. Simply stated, the people were told to give up something they wanted for God's sake. God then promised that He would order a blessing so bountiful that it would produce a triple harvest for three years! 

When will we ever learn that if we follow God's laws of sacrifice and obedience, He is well able to speak to our circumstances with His blessing? Jesus promised, \"I assure you that everyone who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or property, for my sake and for the Good News, will receive now in return, a hundred times over, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and property. . . .\" (Mark 10:29-30). 

Don't resent sacrifice. See it as an opportunity to increase!

Can there be any doubt that the psalmist was referring to Jesus? The disciples were \"filled with dread\" (Mark 10:32) at the fearless, bold approach Jesus exhibited as He walked to Jerusalem, straight into the face of death. He had told them earlier exactly what would happen to Him, yet He did not flinch in leading the way to the city! 

In Leviticus 26:1-39, the Lord promised peace and blessing to the Israelites for obedience, but certain destruction if they rebelled. Christ's intense love for righteousness and hatred of wickedness gives Him a fearless boldness against sin (Psalm 45:7). 

The ultimate act of Jesus' hatred of sin will be demonstrated by His return to earth. He will \"ride out to victory, defending truth, humility, and justice, [going] forth to perform awe-inspiring deeds!\" (Psalm 45:4). His sharp arrows will pierce the hearts of our enemies, and the nations will fall beneath His feet (v. 5). At His side will be the Church, His Bride, who loves Him and also loves righteousness. 

Be faithful and fearless, Bride-Your Mighty One is coming with His sword, and you will be at His side!

Our understanding must change if we are to see that the tithe already belongs to the Lord. When we return it to Him, we are not giving. In fact, if it already belongs to Him, we are actually robbing God if we use the tithe or spend it! 

Not only does the tithe belong to Him, but also it is holy to the Lord. The tithe is holy money, set aside for His holy use. When Achan stole from Jericho something that had been set aside unto God, judgment fell upon Achan and his house (Joshua 7). 

Another aspect of the tithe is that it belongs to the Lord as His advance provision. In Mark 11:3, the little donkey was there by God's prophetic command (Zechariah 9:9), marked out centuries before as provision for what the King would need in that generation. 

A final point regarding the tithe is that God will return your tithe to you with a blessing for your obedience. Weren't the owners of the donkey told, \"The Lord needs it and will return it soon\" (Mark 11:3)? God is not robbing you of ten percent when you tithe-He is using it as an opportunity to bless you!

The tribe of Judah was privileged by God to lead Israel's march through the wilderness. God had already showed His blessing upon that tribe by causing them to increase in number to the largest of all the tribes. Judah means \"praise,\" and this tribe was selected to raise the voice of praise as a battle cry for God's people. As the vast camp set out each day with the blowing of the trumpets, God was displaying to the world that His great Church sets out with a shout of praise. 

The psalmist said, \"God has ascended with a mighty shout. The Lord has ascended with trumpets blaring. Sing praise to God, sing praises; sing praise to our King, sing praises!\" (Psalm 47:5-6). The Church was created to praise the King. Clapping our hands and shouting with cries of joy are the most appropriate things we can do for the One who is the great King over all the earth! 

Jehoshaphat taught God's people to sing and shout as they went out into battle. He \"appointed singers to walk ahead of the army, singing to the Lord and praising him for his holy splendor\" (2 Chronicles 20:21). As a result, the Lord used their praise to defeat their enemies. 

What problem are you facing today?  Why not \"send Judah first\" and watch the Lord fight the battle for you!

God has given two great commandments, the first of which deals with devotion and service to God. Numbers 4:1-33 explains how the three divisions of Levites supervised such work: they were to care for the tabernacle, furniture, and courtyard with the utmost precision and dedication. Similarly, our service to God is not to be slipshod and haphazard, but precise, heartfelt, and fervent. Whatever our ministries, whether small or great, we must serve the Lord with passion. Having even the slightest responsibility for holy things is a privilege! 

The second commandment, to love your neighbor as yourself, is illustrated in Numbers 5:6-7 through the law of restitution. With all our effort, we must make restitution with our neighbors, reconciling any differences with them and treating them with respect and honor, for God keeps account of our dealings with others. As Christians, we are compelled to go the extra mile to ensure our relationships are secured in love. 

Let us build our lives on zealous love for both God and humanity. Such love is the Kingdom of God.

What folly it is to trust in our wealth and boast of our great riches! The psalmist described the futility of hoarding wealth, which has no power to redeem our lives from sin. Ultimately, all the wealth we amass will be left to others. The psalmist continued, saying that the rich will not be pampered forever on their estates. One day they will die, taking none of their worldly wealth with them. Like all men, their bodies will rot in their graves. 

Someone once said, \"You will be dead a lot longer than you will be alive!\" We would be looked upon as foolish to think we could send treasures to heaven ahead of ourselves.  Everyone knows that is impossible. The only way we can take any wealth into eternity is to give it to God here on earth and reap our eternal reward. 

The story of the sacrificial widow clearly illustrates how God will reward us in eternity. It is not the amount given but the amount sacrificed that matters to God. The amount we give may be small, but if it represents great sacrifice, it is of more value to God than great riches. Just as each tabernacle offering was recorded in Numbers 7, so each of our offerings is recorded in God's eternal record. We will find those treasures in heaven for all eternity!

These three little words-our God approaches-are the most certain fact in the universe. We may be going through terrible trials, tribulations, sufferings, and temptations, but we can be certain of one thing: our God is coming! One day Christ will return to earth. A fire will devour before Him (v. 3) as He returns to destroy the Antichrist and his armies. God Himself will be the Judge of His people (v. 6). 

The concept of Jesus' return took center stage as Christ taught His disciples about the end of time. \"However, no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself. Only the Father knows\" (Mark 13:32). Since we cannot know the moment of His return, we must remain diligently on our guard, for His arrival could be \"at evening, midnight, early dawn, or late daybreak\" 

(v. 35). 

As we battle the enemy, we should be constantly looking skyward for the imminent return of our Lord. Focusing on His coming will keep us on guard against sin, compromise, and slothfulness and will encourage us in battle. We must keep our lives equipped and our hearts ready, because there will be no time for preparation at His sudden return. To the sleeping, distracted, halfhearted Christian, Jesus gives one word that will keep him on track for life: \"Watch!\" (Mark 13:37).

The beautiful nature of God is one of sacrifice, the giving of something on behalf of another. The ugly nature of Satan is one of selfishness, the taking of that which belongs to another. 

Never have the spirits of sacrifice and selfishness been so starkly contrasted as in the Mark 14:3-10 story of a generous woman and the self-serving Judas Iscariot. The woman was reckless in her sacrifice, pouring over Jesus' head a perfume so expensive it was worth a whole year's salary. However, her sacrifice seems insignificant when we consider that it was anointing His head for burial. This was the last act of love shown to Jesus before His death. 

Since that time, millions have read and appreciated the memory of her act, even though her money, perfume, and possessions have all long since passed from the scene. In our lives, the unselfish, beautiful sacrifices we make for Jesus and His Body will live and return to us forever. By contrast, Judas's hideously greedy act of fattening his purse with thirty pieces of blood money has gone down in infamy. 

What is the final memory others will have of you? Will it be one of sacrifice or one of selfishness? Break open your \"alabaster jar,\" and pour it all out on the Lord and His people.

The plague of small thinking strikes again! Joshua was extremely concerned that someone other than Moses might be used of God to prophesy. Joshua did not comprehend that God can use whomever He wants in order to accomplish whatever He wants. 

In Numbers 13 the ten spies had to make a decision regarding the grapes and the giants. Huge clusters of fruit should have captured the Israelites' attention, faith, and excitement. Instead, their eyes were on the giants who stood guard over the abundance. 

The devil always tries to get our attention focused more on his resistance than on God's provision. A small, limited vision will make us feel \"like grasshoppers\" in comparison to the giants (Numbers 13:33), instead of feeling that \"we can certainly conquer\" (v. 30)! 

Philip rehearsed to Jesus how impossible it was to feed five thousand men in the wilderness, but Andrew went and found five loaves and two fish. Small thinking involves meditating on negative, impossible thoughts that outweigh the truth of God's Word. Although Moses had told the spies to go into the land with boldness and bring back a sampling of the crops (Numbers 13:20), the spies' fearful thinking caused them to believe that they could never get to the grapes because the giants were too large. 

Think large: Conquest . . . good report . . . well able!

Jesus stood before the high priest and boldly declared who He was. There stood Christ, unafraid of death, declaring before all men His identity and their judgment. His bold, resilient declaration ignited a storm like a match in a powder keg. Oh, what a difference the presence of the Holy Spirit makes as He gives us boldness to fearlessly declare our witness for God!

If \"fearing people is a dangerous trap\" as Proverbs 29:25 declares, then Peter fell headlong into that trap. What a change we can observe in Peter's life, however, when he stood up on the day of Pentecost, demanding repentance from the men who had crucified Christ! 

Joshua and Caleb demonstrated the same boldness when facing a whole assembly that was about to stone them (Numbers 14:10). Never let the fear of man intimidate you in your greatest hour of destiny. Others may run, hide, and deny, but you must stand tall and be bold.

It is true that God will repay those who falsely accuse us, but how hard it is to remain silent and let God exact vengeance! Moses and Aaron knew this truth, as their attitudes remained perfect when faced with the strongest challenge to their authority in the wilderness. The \"gainsaying of Core\" (Jude 11 KJV) is marked as the most slanderous, dangerous illustration of rebellion in the Old Testament. Moses could have easily ordered the opposing leaders' deaths or fought them in a fistfight. Instead, he \"threw himself down with his face to the ground\" (Numbers 16:4). He chose to let God execute His own justice. 

Christ displayed a quiet, humble spirit before Pilate. In spite of wave upon wave of slanderous accusations, \"Jesus said nothing, much to Pilate's surprise\" (Mark 15:5). The moment arrived when both Moses and Jesus were justified by God before all men-Moses when the ground swallowed Korah, and Jesus through the resurrection. 

Be patient, humble, and quiet before your God.  Proclaim with the psalmist, \"But God is my helper. The Lord is the one who keeps me alive!\" (Psalm 54:4).

One rod ended an entire insurrection. What a powerful rod this was to have amazed, confounded, and brought to repentance the powerful forces opposing Moses! The miracle of this rod was that it represented something impossible: a resurrection. How could a dead stick-separated from the tree trunk, polished and smoothed- suddenly sprout leaves, buds, and almonds? Only by the resurrection power of God! 

Christianity is the only religion whose leader was dead for three days and then physically resurrected. While all other religions are as mere sticks with man-made claims to authority, Christianity is distinguished by the fact that Jesus' rod has budded. This budding rod has persuaded millions that He is truly the Son of God. People of every nation stand in awe that someone beaten, crucified, and speared in the side could stand three days later and say, \"All hail.\" 

His name has all authority over demons, disaster, and disease (Mark 16:17-18). We, as His disciples, can stand holding the rod of the resurrection in our hands. Let us preach the Gospel of the resurrected Christ to all creation and watch the Lord confirm His Word with signs following (Mark 16:20)!

Unbelief is dangerous, regardless of who you are. Zechariah, a member of the priestly tribe, was standing in the Holy Place offering incense before God when an angel of the Lord brought him a message. Because he refused to believe the message and questioned the power of God, Zechariah was struck dumb. 

Another example of unbelief is found in Numbers 20:11-12, which tells how Moses' and Aaron's lack of trust in God led them to act rashly. They struck the rock twice instead of merely speaking to it as God had instructed. This simple act of unbelief disqualified them from their long-awaited entrance into the Promised Land. 

God does not exempt His leaders from judgment if they fail to walk before Him in the purity of faith. He \"doesn't show partiality\" (Acts 10:34) and equally dispenses judgment on all who refuse to believe. His judgment can be swift and stern, as when Uzzah was struck dead for steadying the ark of the covenant after the oxen stumbled (1 Chronicles 13:9-10). In another instance, \"Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu put coals of fire in their incense burners and sprinkled incense over it\" (Leviticus 10:1) and were immediately burned alive by the fire of God. 

God is awesome in His holiness and will not be disregarded.  Let's serve Him with the proper respect and awe, \"for our God is a consuming fire\" (Hebrews 12:29).

No better example of this scripture can be found than in the story of the little maiden named Mary. Though she was young and from a lowly town in Galilee called Nazareth, Mary believed God. Because of her belief, all generations have called her blessed. 

The examples from the Bible are many of those whom God exalted. As a nation, Israel was blessed and exalted. When Balak tried to curse God's people, God told him, \"You are not to curse these people, for I have blessed them!\" (Numbers 22:12). Yet another example of the exalting of the Lord is found in the life of David, who was taken from the field while tending a few sheep and exalted to be king of Israel. Joseph, who was languishing in an Egyptian prison, also witnessed the blessing of the Lord that brought him to Pharaoh's right hand in exaltation. 

We must value the blessing of the Lord upon our lives because it exalts us before the heathen and brings great glory to God. May the blessing bestowed upon a simple virgin of Nazareth remind us of one eternal truth: God's \"mighty arm does tremendous things! How he scatters the proud and haughty ones! He has taken princes from their thrones and exalted the lowly\" (Luke 1:51-52). 

Be blessed . . . then exalted!

The tongue is the center of sin in the body. In James 3:6 it is described as a \"flame of fire,\" capable of causing much wickedness. How important it is, therefore, that the tongue be used for the purposes of God! 

In Numbers 22 we see an astounding miracle of speech rendered by God. Balaam's donkey obviously could not speak, but it was given words to rebuke Balaam in his madness (v. 28). If God could open the mouth of a donkey, how much more can He open our mouths for His glory! Further along in the story, Balaam, being unable to curse Israel with his mouth, could only speak a blessing over the nation. 

In the story of Elizabeth and Zechariah, God struck Zechariah dumb for nine months because he had used his tongue to voice unbelief. Then God healed him supernaturally and filled his mouth with a blessing for Israel (Luke 1:67). Zechariah absolutely overflowed with praise to the God of Israel who was showing them mercy, rescuing them from their enemies, and granting them salvation. 

Before we met Christ, we used our mouths to curse, defile, and destroy others. Now that Christ lives in us, we can yield our speech to the Holy Spirit so we may instruct, correct, and encourage others. Offer your tongue to God as \"the pen of a skillful poet\" (Psalm 45:1). He will fill your mouth with praise and prophecy that will bring glory to God and bind the powers of darkness.

We call the leading character in a movie, a play, or an athletic event the star. God has a Star and desires that every eye be upon Him! 

In his final prophecies, Balaam saw a vision of a star rising out of Jacob. In the distance beyond the camp of Israel, Balaam could see Israel's supreme Leader who would crush Moab. When the devil looks out over the Church, he is blinded by the light of our Bright and Morning Star, the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus rises above all our enemies in His glory. 

The shepherds saw the Star of all history face-to-face the night He was born in a manger (Luke 2:16). Tradition says the star Balaam saw was the same one the wise men followed from the East to find Christ. Moved by the Spirit, Simeon entered the temple and held in his arms the \"light to reveal God to the nations\" (Luke 2:32). 

May we never move our eyes away from the Centerpiece of God's universe: Jesus, the Star of Jacob.

God is a God of victory. The Church is not on the defensive, but displays a banner of victory. We see this banner as David went into battle, for he reminded himself of God's overwhelming strength against the enemy. We see this banner in Romans 8:31, where Paul wrote, \"If God is for us, who can ever be against us?\" 

The nations of the world do not belong to the devil, but to God. His Church is the means by which the nations will be conquered. The first part of Psalm 60:8 declares, \"Moab will become my lowly servant,\" meaning that the nations will serve the Church. The second part of that verse says, \"Over Edom will I cast out my shoe\" (KJV), indicating ownership. (In biblical times, ownership was marked by a person's taking off his shoe and throwing it down upon his inheritance.) 

How many nations are waiting to be claimed by the Body of Christ? Let's \"take our shoes off\"and begin in prayer to \"throw them down\" upon our inheritance. Let's lift high the banner of the cross of Christ, valiantly defying the claim of the enemy over our God-given heritage. May we never forget that \"in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us\" (Romans 8:37 KJV).

Your spiritual inheritance is the most important thing you possess. The daughters of Zelophehad knew that and thus demanded their inheritance (Numbers 27:4). They refused to let any factor stand in their way of possessing what their father had left to them, and consequently, God honored their faith. 

Your spiritual inheritance may be the transfer of someone else's anointing to you before that person's death. Moses transferred his anointing to Joshua by the laying on of hands (Numbers 27:23). Jesus received His inheritance when He went into the Jordan and was baptized by John (Luke 3:21-22). Elisha appropriated his inheritance when he saw Elijah go up in a whirlwind and drop his mantle from the chariot (2 Kings 2:11-13). 

God has given you a mantle of inheritance-some ministry, some mission, some calling-that belongs to you alone. Will you be like Esau who despised his inheritance and birthright and sold it all for a little bowl of soup? Never forfeit or throw your heritage away as though it were worthless. Instead, seize it, claim it, and believe that God will use it to glorify His name.

Faith is trust, and trust is faith. When a deposit is placed in a trust account, we can be confident that it is safe. Do we trust God like that? It is easy to trust Him when we are in control, but what about when the situation moves outside our control? Can we trust Him at all times? David went through perilous times, but in each situation he would pour out his heart to God (v. 8) as his chief Confidant and Refuge. 

Everyone trusts someone or something, and with many, it is their money. \"Don't try to get rich by extortion or robbery. And if your wealth increases, don't make it the center of your life\" (Psalm 62:10). Paul told Timothy to \"tell those who are rich in this world not to be proud and not to trust in their money, which will soon be gone. But their trust should be in the living God, who richly gives us all we need for our enjoyment\" (1 Timothy 6:17).  

We must unplug our trust from anything in this world: our money, the promises of others, even ourselves. We must then transfer our total trust to God and relax, knowing that our deposit is safe!

Jesus spent His first forty days after baptism in the wilderness east of Jerusalem. Far from the distractions of life, He passed through the fires of temptation and learned total dependence upon God. 

Moses said to Israel, \"Anything made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead-that is, metals that do not burn-must be passed through fire in order to be made ceremonially pure\" (Numbers 31:22-23). Nothing is acceptable to God unless it has been passed through the fire. Temptation proves the quality of your \"metal.\" Though Jesus was severely tempted three times by the devil, He came forth as purest gold. 

While Jesus was passing through the temptation, a second dynamic was taking place in His life: He was drawing into close communion with the Father. His soul and His body, though fasting, were satisfied with \"more than the richest of foods\" (Psalm 63:5) as He learned to cling to God (v. 8) in close communion. 

These two lessons are our greatest challenges: \"Resist the Devil\" and \"draw close to God\" (James 4:7-8). Are you ready for the lessons of the wilderness?

Israel realized that the gods of Egypt that had held them captive for so long were defeated through the ten plagues. For example, the \"god of the Nile\" was defeated when the mighty river was turned to blood (Exodus 7:20-21), and the \"sun god\" was defeated by the darkness that fell upon the land (Exodus 10:21-23). After the final plague concerning the firstborn, the Israelites were free to go. Triumphantly they left the land of their captivity. They did not slither out of town or run for their lives in the night. Instead, they \"left defiantly, in full view of all the Egyptians\" (Numbers 33:3). 

As New Testament believers, we have the same privilege of boldness as did the Israelites. Jesus has conquered our enemies: \"The time of judgment for the world has come, when the prince of this world will be cast out\" (John 12:31). Therefore, we should exhibit the same boldness against the devil as did Jesus when He openly ordered the demon to \"be silent\" (Luke 4:35). Jesus saw sickness and demonic possession as an unfair encroachment of the enemy, and so should we.

Forgiveness and mercy are the highest items on God's agenda. The city of refuge was a designated place of grace where someone who had made a mistake could run for shelter and protection from revenge. When the high priest died, the person who had been spared from judgment was also restored to a normal life. 

The man let down through the roof into Jesus' presence heard Jesus tell him, \"Son, your sins are forgiven\" (Luke 5:20). That one statement encompassed both his forgiveness and his healing. When your sins are forgiven, healing is easy! 

Jesus, our High Priest, died in our place. Now we are free to live as forgiven, restored sinners. When we were overcome by our sins, Jesus forgave our transgressions (Psalm 65:3). Though we cannot see sin, it is an overwhelming enemy. It afflicts us, crushes the life out of us, and can take us to hell forever. 

Run to the city of refuge! Run to the mercy seat! You are forgiven through the blood of Christ, and now, like the paralytic, you can \"stand up, take your mat, and go on home\" (Luke 5:24).

Three powerful verses in Proverbs 11 remind us of the ageless principles of giving. First, you cannot outgive God. Proverbs 11:24 says, \"It is possible to give freely and become more wealthy, but those who are stingy will lose everything.\" Giving is the secret to abundance and increase. 

Second, if your purpose in life is to \"refresh others\" (Proverbs 11:25) and not just be concerned for yourself, God will be sure to supply your own needs as well. You must make it your goal in life to bring joy and happiness to others through generously giving to them. You will be personally refreshed from watching their joy, and God will make certain that someone comes along occasionally to refresh you! 

Finally, if you hoard what you have been given instead of sharing it, you will be cursed instead of blessed (Proverbs 11:26). Because giving is so much a part of God's nature, your gift brings you into His heavenly economy. Even though you may have a need, invest in others, and you will gain, prosper, and be crowned with blessing!

It is no accident that the word forgive comes from the word give. Jesus taught both principles in conjunction with each other. If you forgive, you will receive forgiveness.  If you give, others will also give to you. The spirits of forgiveness and giving are opposite from the spirits of the devil. 

People in the world lash out at anyone who mistreats or abuses them. Jesus said, however,\"God blesses you who are hated and excluded and mocked and cursed because you are identified with me, the Son of Man. When that happens, rejoice! Yes, leap for joy! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. . ..\" (Luke 6:22-23). He also encouraged His disciples to love, do good, and pray for those who mistreated them (vv. 27-28). In the same passage He continued, saying, \"Give what you have to anyone who asks you for it; and when things are taken away from you, don't try to get them back\" (v. 30). 

You are called to be God's channel of mercy. He wants to use you to pour His grace and blessing upon the world. You must not block that flow through unforgiveness or stinginess. You must let forgiveness and giving flow. When you do, God will bless you, \"full measure, pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, and running over\" (Luke 6:38). Give and forgive. \"Then your reward from heaven will be very great....\" (v. 35).

God is different from all other supposed gods in that He is invisible and His Word is His power. The idols of the earth are just senseless, speechless gods \"that neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell\" (v. 28). By contrast, our God is a \"devouring fire, a jealous God\" (v. 24). How important it is then for us to hear and heed His voice! 

The centurion in the New Testament recognized the power of Jesus' voice: \"Just say the word from where you are, and my servant will be healed\" (Luke 7:7). Our faith, too, rests in the voice of our invisible God. When God speaks, it is with the voice of absolute authority. His Word contains the power of His ability! 

Why do we look for tokens and trinkets of religion when we have His Word? Whether thundering and booming from Sinai or softly spoken from the pages of our Bible, His Word is the same. \"The Lord announced the word, and great was the company of those who proclaimed it\" (Psalm 68:11 NIV).

Loving the Lord your God with all your heart is the greatest commandment. It means you should love Him intimately-an action called worship. One who loves his beloved intimately is totally focused on that person, giving to him his heart, soul, and strength. 

In heaven, the angels and saints spend eternity worshiping and loving God. Should it be odd for us to spend time with Him now, worshiping and loving the One who is the total focus of our lives? 

The second great commandment says, \"Love your neighbor as yourself\" (Leviticus 19:18). We call this action ministry. Jesus modeled this commandment when He met the funeral procession coming out of Nain. Luke records, \"When the Lord saw her, his heart overflowed with compassion. \"Don't cry!' he said\" (Luke 7:13). 

This is true ministry: loving people and their problems with all your heart, soul, and strength. Learn to make your worship to God and your ministry to people the two focal points of your life. This is love and the path to eternal joy.

The women who traveled with Jesus and His disciples were \"contributing from their own resources to support Jesus and his disciples\" 

(Luke 8:3). Joanna was the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod's household. She obviously was a person of great means, and God used her as a channel to supply the needs of the Son of God here on earth. 

What a privilege it must have been to give one's personal wealth for Jesus' daily provision of food, clothing, and shelter! While Jesus presented the life-giving Word to the cities and villages in the area, these generous and loving women kept the supply lines open to the battlefront. 

Wealth is given by God to finance His purposes in redeeming humanity (Deuteronomy 8:17-18). He blessed His people in Palestine, \"a land where food is plentiful and nothing is lacking\" (v. 9). He still blesses His people with wealth today, not so they can hoard it and become proud, but as a means for world evangelism. 

Claim your abundance, and then pour it upon the feet of Jesus (Luke 7:37-38). You will not lose your wealth, for in eternity you will find it again.

A proud, resistant heart pays no attention to the Word of God. Israel was stubborn, self-willed, disobedient, and hardhearted. How often have we followed suit and lived in habits and patterns that were obviously contrary to the Word of God? However, a tender heart that receives the Word of God and submits to it is precious to the Lord. 

Jesus encouraged His disciples to be those of a noble and good heart, who heard the Word, retained it, and by persevering would \"steadily produce a huge harvest\" (Luke 8:15). The more tender our hearts and the more attentive our ears, the more revelation God will give us (v. 18). Jesus' own mother and brothers did not qualify as much as those who heard God's Word and put it into practice (v. 21). 

When you read something in God's Word, receive it with a tender, honest heart. Give it first place, apply it, and let it change you. As you do, you will cultivate the ground of your heart for a harvest-thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold!

The psalmist was concerned that he not be forsaken until God declared His power to the next generation. Every generation must know firsthand the power of God. It is not enough to hear about how God visited the previous generation in great power, wonders, and miracles. Our generation must see that power manifested. Without a true manifestation of the power of God, each generation grows progressively dubious of God's reality.

\"One day Jesus called together his twelve apostles and gave them power and authority to cast out demons and to heal all diseases\" (Luke 9:1). This action was more than simple religious protocol-it was a transferal of Jesus' power to the next generation. What would have happened to the world if Christ had departed without giving anyone the same power He had to help people?

The same power that flowed from Christ's robes to heal the woman with the issue of blood is available today. From generation to generation, God's power has been passed on. Now it is our turn to rise up and show God's power to the next generation.

How important it is to have your own knowledge of the Word of God! What your parents or grandparents knew and taught you about the Word of God should not be your only source of revelation. Your own eyes must see God's Word, and then you must hide it inside your heart. 

If Solomon had obeyed Moses' command to produce a handwritten copy of the law (Deuteronomy 17:14-20), he would have known for himself some important things. For example, he would have known not to acquire horses from Egypt, take multiple wives, or accumulate large amounts of silver and gold (vv. 16-17). Obedience to these three simple commands would have kept him from all his troubles. In fact, however, these were the very sins he committed (1 Kings 10:26-11:13). What a tragedy! If only Solomon had hidden God's Word in his heart, he might not have sinned against God (Psalm 119:11).  

Your own personal, diligent, daily study of the Word will undoubtedly protect you from much deception and heartache. Moses passed down suitable guidelines for a king, instructing that he read them daily throughout his life. In the same way, if you read God's Word every day and hide its truths in your heart, you will be equipped to live it.

Moses spoke of a prophet who would be raised up from among his own brothers. He would be so powerful that His word would be final. Anyone who did not listen to Him would have to give an account to God. 

All Israel watched and waited for the special prophet. The priests and Levites asked John the Baptist if he were \"that prophet\" (John 1:21 KJV). On the day of Pentecost, Peter quoted the verse from Deuteronomy 18 to show how the Lord Jesus Christ was the Prophet spoken of. As such, He was God's ultimate mouthpiece and final authority. After years of looking for the prophet, Moses finally saw Him face-to-face on the Mount of Transfiguration (Luke 9:30-31). 

The nations of the world are looking for some sorcerer, diviner, teacher, or prophet who can tell them the mind of God. They need look no further! We have found \"that Prophet\" in Christ.

Jesus set for His disciples the example of a resolute life. He was determined to accomplish His purpose for coming to this earth.  He tolerated no double-mindedness in His followers. He wanted them to be determined, resolved, bold, and steady. He challenged them to totally cast aside their comforts, worldly desires, and ties to family (both living and dead) in order to put their hands to the \"gospel plow.\" 

In order to follow Him, His disciples needed to be like Him. In the final days of His life, He issued two simple commands to them: \"come\" and \"go.\" First, he commanded, \"Come, be my disciple\" (Luke 9:59), encouraging them to imitate His example of resolve.  Next, he challenged them, saying, \"Go now, and remember that I am sending you out as lambs among wolves\" (Luke 10:3). The disciples were given clear instruction to waste no time on greetings along the way or in lingering in towns that rejected the gospel message. 

Time is of the essence when the harvest is ripe and a storm is approaching. Similarly, there is a spiritual harvest of souls waiting to be reaped. We must leave behind earthly distractions and work passionately for God, like Jesus did, recognizing that \"there is little time left before the night falls and all work comes to an end\" (John 9:4). 

The Law commanded, \"Do not plow with an ox and a donkey harnessed together\" (Deuteronomy 22:10). If you hook up to the gospel plow, don't mix with the wrong company. Be single-minded and resolute, straining \"to reach the end of the race and receive the prize for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us up to heaven\" (Philippians 3:14).

As used in this context, your neighbor means \"someone near.\" God has positioned near us all kinds of people with all kinds of needs. By showing love and generosity to such people, we are fulfilling one of the greatest commandments. 

The children of Israel were told to treat a runaway slave as a neighbor and to give him refuge (Deuteronomy 23:15). They were also told not to barge into a neighbor's house to take an article for collateral. They were to let the person bring it out to them, and if the neighbor was poor and had only a cloak for collateral, they could not keep it overnight. In addition, they were told to leave intentional harvests of wheat, olives, and grapes for the poor (Deuteronomy 24:10-13,19-21). 

The generosity of the Good Samaritan to his \"neighbor,\" someone who was near, distinguished his true religion from the selfish religion of the Levite and priest (Luke 10:25-35). Likewise, Jesus' commandment to us is \"Now go and do the same\" (v. 37). 

We complicate our religion when we think of it as distant and difficult. In fact, it is near-as near as a neighbor in need. If we focus our love and generosity on neighbors in need, God will meet our own needs in return.

Love for a neighbor is always measured (as it was in the story of the Good Samaritan) in practical ways. Love for God, however, is often measured in impractical ways. In Martha's opinion, Mary was wasting her time sitting at the Lord's feet while the details in the kitchen required her attention (Luke 10:39-40). The woman who lavished her ointment on the head of Jesus was also accused of being impractical and of wasting money (Matthew 26:7-9). 

We show our love for people by service. We show our love for God by worship. One who worships does not count the pennies or the hours but sees only the immense value of the Person he is worshiping. To the outside world, which measures everything by its efficiency, these dollars and hours seem wasteful. But to those who love God from their hearts, the money and time expended are only a trifling pittance. 

When it comes to loving people, we must be very practical, but when it comes to worshiping God, we must lay aside our desire to be busy. In our love for God, let us detach ourselves from an earthly mentality. Even if our practical, reasoning side says, \"You're being wasteful,\" let's lavish our time and money upon the Lord in true worship.

Power over the enemy is a sign of God's blessing upon a person's life. In contrast, Jesus said that a man who had no blessing in his life would be attacked by seven other spirits more evil than the first spirit (Luke 11:26). In the absence of the blessing of God, demons rush in \"to steal and kill and destroy\" (John 10:10). In every area of life-financial, physical, mental, and marital-these demons will run roughshod and wreak havoc to their hearts' content. 

No blessing . . . no protection! Without God's blessing, Israel could expect continual shortfalls, diseases, plagues, depression, anxiety, and broken families. However, with God's blessing, no enemy could affect Israel and no lack could come near God's people. 

Because we are the blessed, let us march triumphantly against our enemies and watch them flee. \"When the Red Sea saw you, O God, its waters looked and trembled! The sea quaked to its very depths\" (Psalm 77:16). Demons always tremble when God begins to march! In seven directions they flee in terror; therefore, \"resist the devil, and he will flee from you\" (James 4:7 NIV).

The Pharisees were bitter men, envious of Jesus and angry about His pure, sweet teaching. A root of bitterness will corrupt many (Hebrews 12:15). A fountain cannot produce sweet and bitter water at the same time (James 3:11), and a person's heart is the wellspring of his life. 

The secret to life, prosperity, and blessing is a heart that is pure, sweet, and undefiled. How quickly the envy and greed of the world can turn someone's heart bitter and sour toward individuals or races! Moses warned the Israelites that if they harbored poisonous roots of bitterness in their hearts toward God or one another, their land would become a burning waste of salt and sulfur. The Israelites failed to heed the warning, however, and for forty years were bitter at God, Moses, and one another. Consequently, one by one their corpses fell in the wilderness. 

Bitterness is a taste in your mouth-a flavor that colors every experience and relationship. If any bitter roots are lodged in your heart today, ask the Holy Spirit to pull them out. In so doing, you are choosing life, \"that you and your descendants might live!\" (Deuteronomy 30:19).

Moses' song was intended to remind the Israelites that if they backslid, they would be neglecting the Rock who fathered them and the God who had given them birth (Deuteronomy 32:18). That Rock, who is Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4), had followed them in the wilderness and provided drink for them for forty years. How could they ever have turned their backs on their Rock? Perhaps the Israelites took God for granted, thinking they could provide for and defend themselves without His help. 

Our lives are confused and insecure when we leave our Rock in order to build our lives on shifting sand (Matthew 7:26-27). The rich fool thought he was secure in his barns and possessions, but he found out that his life was built on a false foundation (Luke 12:16-21). We can look high and low, trying to find security in money, positions, organizations, and even nations. Unfortunately, we will find that all these things will eventually crumble and turn to dust. 

Although the world puts its trust in things and people that disappoint, decide today to seek the immovable Rock of the Kingdom of God. \"He will give you all you need from day to day if you make the Kingdom of God your primary concern\" (Luke 12:31).

The Kingdom of God does not belong to the slothful and careless. Jesus taught that the person who is a \"faithful, sensible servant\" (Luke 12:42) will be amply rewarded for his diligence when the master returns. 

All your time, money, talents, and influence have been given to you as tests of your faithfulness. You are tested on earth so your eternal position may be fairly and justly assigned. It really doesn't matter how high or low your station in life or how much earthly wealth you attain. It matters only how faithful you are in that station and with the wealth you have been given. 

Whatever your status, be diligent (hardworking, persevering, and careful in work), making the most with even a little. The more faithful you are with a little, the more God can entrust to you. Sometimes He is watching to see what you will do with a little before He gives you much. 

\"Laziness ends in slave labor\" (Proverbs 12:24 NIV), but diligence brings reward. In eternity, your reward for diligence will be to rule over entire cities (Luke 19:17). So persevere! Be faithful in little and God will reward you with much!

Moses gave his final blessing upon God's people, and we, the children of Abraham, can lay claim by faith to the rich pronouncements found in Deuteronomy 33. 

First, God promised that His people would \"dwell between His shoulders\" in security (Deuteronomy 33:12 KJV). There is no greater security and protection than in riding on the back of the Lord! 

Next, He said His children would enjoy \"the best gifts of the earth and its fullness\" (v. 16). Because God made the earth, He can certainly cause it to yield its best for His own. 

In addition, He promised His people physical strength for their entire lives (v. 25). Jesus offered this same promise to another child of Abraham hundreds of years later: \"Wasn't it necessary for me, even on the Sabbath day, to free this dear woman from the bondage in which Satan has held her for eighteen years?\" (Luke 13:16). Healing and strength are part of the blessing of the Lord. 

Finally, He promised His children the peace and security of the everlasting arms underneath them (Deuteronomy 33:27). Security in an insecure world is priceless, and it belongs to us. Let's lay claim to our blessings, for we are people saved by the Lord (Deuteronomy 33:29).

Fear and timidity cripple and paralyze. Three times the Lord told Joshua to be strong and courageous (Joshua 1:6-7, 9). Even Joshua's own people echoed God's encouragement to him (v. 18). God cannot use timid, fearful vessels to accomplish the mighty conquests He envisions for His people. 

How helpful it would be if we could only see that our enemies are melting in fear because of us (2:9)! If we could take a peek at the enemy's camp, we would see how fearful they are of those who are in Christ. Gideon was privileged to see this when he crept down to the enemy's camp and found the soldiers so frightened that they were dreaming about Gideon's might against them (Judges 7:13-14). 

Satan always tries to intimidate before the battle begins. When the Pharisees tried to frighten Jesus regarding Herod, Jesus replied, \"Go tell that fox that . . . I will accomplish my purpose\" (Luke 13:32). Nothing could deter Him from His purpose because He knew the power resident in Him. 

When the enemy threatens and intimidates, arise in courage and boldness and go forward. Remember: Satan knows what the Lord has planned for us. “I promise you what I promised Moses: ‘Everywhere you go, you will be on land I have given you.’” (Joshua 1:3) Be strong!

The most powerful illustration of God's presence going before His people is that of the Israelites as they crossed the Jordan with the ark of the covenant leading them. The ark represented God's throne, His power, and His might. It went ahead of Israel into the battle at Jericho and brought the Israelites victory. Indeed, if the ark had not gone before them, they would have been on their own. 

Whatever impossible circumstance may stand before you will surely be defeated as God's presence arrives in the battle. Joshua 3:13 says that when the feet of the priests who carried the ark touched the water, the flow of water was cut off upstream and the river piled up there in a heap. 

As you come to your \"Jordan,\" set your foot into the water. How dare the proud waters defy God's presence and power! The foot of faith carries the arm of omnipotence. One little step of faith releases all the power of God into your situation. Let God's face shine against the darkness!

Paul's teaching about sinners focuses on God's real purpose in sending Jesus: to save those who are lost. Miserable, undone sinners are \"the stuff\" from which Jesus makes miracles. Often the lower a sinner sinks, the greater the glory God receives when the sinner repents. 

Rahab, the prostitute in Jericho, was probably the lowest social outcast in the city (Joshua 6:17). However, God was willing to spare her and her entire family because she was repentant. In God's sovereign choice to use her, Rahab first was spared from destruction. Then she actually became one of the four women mentioned in Matthew 1 as a direct ancestor of King David and Jesus Christ Himself (v. 5). 

Can you see how God loves to take the \"things despised by the world, things counted as nothing at all . . . to bring to nothing what the world considers important, so that no one can ever boast in the presence of God\" (1 Corinthians 1:28-29)? He will run to meet any sinner who comes to his senses and returns to Him saying, \"Father, I have sinned\" (Luke 15:21). Let us rejoice with the angels today over even one sinner who repents!

Money tests our hearts, our motives, and our character. What we do with it will prove to God whether He can entrust us with the \"true riches of heaven\" spoken of in Luke 16:11. The spirit of covetousness ruled the Pharisees. The Lord warned them that they could not \"serve both God and money\" (v. 13), but verse 14 says they \"dearly loved their money,\" ignoring the Lord's stern admonition to them. 

The principle of covetousness is immortalized in the story of Achan in the Old Testament. God gave explicit instructions to Joshua that no one was to touch anything of value in Jericho. The entire city was God's, dedicated to Him as the holy first fruits of the Canaan conquest. Achan's hand, however, could not resist grasping a bar of gold, coins of silver, and a beautiful Babylonian coat. His sin followed a familiar pattern: \"I saw . . . I wanted . . . I took them . . . They are hidden\" (Joshua 7:21). 

Our eyes can look enviously on things that do not belong to us, and covetousness can lead us to \"take\" and \"hide\" that which is not ours. How much better to follow the wisdom of Luke 16:9: \"I tell you, use your worldly resources to benefit others and make friends. In this way, your generosity stores up a reward for you in heaven.\" 

Use worldly wealth; don't let it use you!

Satan forms alliances with those who desire to \"take possession of the pasturelands of God\" (Psalm 83:12 NIV). Joshua and his forces faced enemies who united in one common pursuit: to extinguish the light of God's people from the face of the earth (Joshua 10:3-4). Though our enemies join forces to destroy us, they are still no match for our God. 

In incredible fashion, God loosed the destructive forces of nature against Israel's enemies. First, He threw hailstones from heaven to smite the Amorites. Then, as though the enemy could have escaped such destruction, God actually stopped the sun and moon for the better part of an entire day to provide enough light for Israel to pursue the fleeing armies (Joshua 10:11-14). 

There is no stopping our Commander-in-Chief. The Lord will make our enemies blow away \"like whirling dust, like chaff before the wind\" (Psalm 83:13)! Have you ever watched the whirling dust of a dust storm? It flies so fast that it only touches the ground occasionally. Pursue your enemies; God will \"blow them away.\" Though they have declared war on God, they are no match for His anger. Remember: He is the \"Most High, supreme over all the earth\" (v. 18).

Everyone, no matter how small or insignificant, can be included in God's house. Can you imagine God taking time to record that He is concerned about a swallow's having a place to nest in His house? God's house is big and wide. It has room for anyone who desires to come under His shadow and eat from His table. And the fare in God's house is delightful! 

Psalm 84 says that the people in God's house are always praising Him (v. 4). They are always full of strength (v. 7), drawing fresh energy like a tree planted by the waters. Their prayers are always heard (v. 8) because they are so close to Him that praying is as natural as breathing. Furthermore, their needs are always met (v. 11). 

Luke 17:15-16 tells us how the lowly Samaritan leper found a place in God's house. Being a foreigner, he was not allowed to enter the earthly temple and show himself to the priest. Instead, he found an even better place at the feet of Jesus, the High Priest over the house of God. 

Come in and dwell in the courts of the Lord. The door is open, and there will always be a place for you!

Caleb was a man of unrelenting pursuit. His eyes had seen a mountain, and Moses had given him a promise. Although he was now eighty-five years old, his resolve and desire to possess the promise were undiminished. He said to Joshua, \"So I'm asking you to give me the hill country that the Lord promised me\" (Joshua 14:12). Then this elderly man of faith promptly went in and drove out the giants who lived there! 

Forty-five years of waiting did nothing to daunt this man's purposes in God. How often do we \"circle the mountain\" one time and then decide it is not the will of God for us to receive what we need? In many instances recorded in the Bible, people of faith had to persevere in order to receive the promise. For example, Elijah prayed seven times before he saw the cloud of rain, and Joshua marched seven days until the walls of Jericho toppled. 

In the parable of the importuning widow (Luke 18:5), Jesus taught the importance of persistence. If an unjust judge would eventually grant the request of a persistent widow, how much more will a compassionate God answer the prayers of His righteous saints? 

Pursue your dream. And until the dream comes to pass, continue to proclaim, \"Give me this hill country!\"

Like Caleb, Bartimaeus was a man of persistence. He refused to stop calling out for mercy even when others demanded that he be quiet (Luke 18:39). He knew that Jesus was \"so good, so ready to forgive, so full of unfailing love\" (Psalm 86:5) to all who called on His name. 

To get the attention of this God of mercy, your call of faith must never grow weary but must remain fervent. Something about seriousness attracts God's compassion. A halfhearted request may impress the world, but God knows when you have reached a place of desperation. 

Bartimaeus was tired of blindness and cared nothing about public opinion. His fervent pleading drew the attention of the Son of God, and his miracle brought much glory to God. The woman with the issue of blood showed the same determination when she pressed in to touch the hem of Jesus' garment. 

Remember the words of Psalm 86:17: \"Send me a sign of your favor. Then those who hate me will be put to shame, for you, O Lord, help and comfort me.\" Keep calling out fervently, for the God of mercy is listening.

Joshua rebuked the seven tribes who had not yet asserted their victory over the Canaanites. Why? Like many of us, they were waiting for God, while in reality God was waiting for them! Joshua's rebuke to the Israelites was that though God had already given them the land, they refused to pay the price to possess it. 

Similarly, the lazy steward of Luke 19:20 demonstrated no initiative to become involved in the risky, dangerous world of investment. He simply took the money his master had given him and hid it away. Though he blamed his master for his lack of effort, the real fault lay with him. 

God has given you certain talents and gifts, but He will never force you to use them. Yes, it will cost you something to use your talents, and you may even fail once or twice. You will have to practice, sacrifice, and learn, but you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you (Philippians 4:13). 

Step out of the boat and onto the water as Peter did. Your eternal reward depends upon your assertiveness, so stop being passive and go take a few cities!

Christ certainly felt the burden of a city that refused His grace (Luke 19:41). Jerusalem had every opportunity to repent, having seen great miracles and having heard the Lord's greatest sermons. The knowledge that Jerusalem would finally reject and crucify Him caused Jesus to weep over a lost opportunity. 

Paul also felt heartsick over Israel's rejection of the Gospel: \"My heart is filled with bitter sorrow and unending grief for my people, my Jewish brothers and sisters. I would be willing to be forever cursed-cut off from Christ!-if that would save them\" (Romans 9:2-3). 

Have you ever thought that a certain person would surely repent after hearing a particular sermon or experiencing an especially painful situation in his life, and yet he did not? Intercession can arise from deferred hope, knowing that God is waiting to bless, but human beings are resisting. The pain and agony of watching others miss God's best in their lives should be turned into a continual prayer on their behalf. 

Keep on standing for your lost loved ones. As long as they are alive and breathing, there is still hope. Imagine the joy you will experience when they turn their lives over to God!

Jesus is the Cornerstone. A cornerstone is a large, immovable stone that sets the direction for an entire building. Trying to test and move Jesus by questions and tricks was impossible-a point the Pharisees amply proved. He is unchangeable Truth, the Rock of integrity and honesty. If you try to move Him or persuade Him to change His standard, you will be crushed (v. 18) as that Stone falls on you. You can't go around Him, under Him, or over Him. 

Proverbs 13:15 says, \"A person with good sense is respected; a treacherous person walks a rocky road.\" Being treacherous means you're trying to push God's truth out of your life! Why not build on the truth rather than trying to budge it? Don't alter it, try to move it, or break it. Fall upon that Stone and let Him break your will to pieces. Then allow the Holy Spirit to build your life upon the foundation of eternal truth. 

Align the walls of your life to match the direction of the Cornerstone. A life built upon His truth will last for all eternity. He will never change. Isn't it time you did?

Although the Israelites had been granted the victory, it still took them a long time to subdue their enemies. \"Little by little\" and \"inch by inch\" is the pattern for gaining the territory promised to you. Sometimes your progress may be very slow, but you must fight on because every enemy you leave in your territory will become \"a pain in your side and a thorn in your eyes\" (Joshua 23:13). 

Christ Himself is now seated at the right hand of God until He makes your enemies a footstool for your feet (Luke 20:43). Though the battle may be long, you are assured a victory in the end: \"Each one of you will put to flight a thousand of the enemy, for the Lord your God fights for you, just as he has promised\" (Joshua 23:10). Fight on until every promise from God comes true, for surely the enemy who contests you is trying to resist the Word of God. The promise in Psalm 89:23 is clear: \"I will beat down his adversaries before him and destroy those who hate him.\" 

In the midst of the long battle, remember that your character is being transformed. \"Count it all joy\" . . . your patience is growing (James 1:2 KJV)!

Jesus saw a terrible scene coming to Jerusalem in the not-too-distant future. He saw the Roman legions invading Jerusalem and completely destroying it in A.D. 70. Josephus, the Jewish historian, reported that more than one million Jews died during this invasion, thousands of them by crucifixion outside of Jerusalem. The city was so leveled that a plow was pulled across it from side to side. David also foretold this horrible event: \"You have renounced your covenant with him, for you have thrown his crown in the dust. You have broken down the walls protecting him and laid in ruins every fort defending him\" (Psalm 89:39-40). 

The price for rejecting truth is high, and history, unfortunately, is strewn with the wreckage of civilizations that did just that. Joshua told the Israelites that if they forsook the Lord, He would turn against them, bring disaster on them, and make an end of them (Joshua 24:20). God gives a season of opportunity to repent, but then, like a potter fashioning his pot, He destroys the vessel and makes another. 

Determine to be like Joshua, who said, \"But as for me and my family, we will serve the Lord\" (Joshua 24:15). History will prove you right!

Secret sins will always be exposed in the light of God's presence. Judas thought he would make a profit by selling the knowledge of Christ's whereabouts for thirty pieces of silver (Matthew 26:14-16). 

The sin of the love of money (1 Timothy 6:10) has deceived millions into living only for this life. Moses instructed Israel, \"Teach us to make the most of our time, so that we may grow in wisdom\" (Psalm 90:12). A person who makes the most of his time understands the brevity of life. That person knows that soon our days, like our money, will be expended. 

What are thirty pieces of silver in the light of eternity? Where is Judas's money now? After Judas threw it into the temple, the priests collected it and used it to buy the field where Judas hanged himself. Where is Ananias and Sapphira's money? Their greed bought them an early death (Acts 5). Where is Felix's money? Felix kept asking Paul to come and speak to him in hopes of getting a bribe, but he never succeeded (Acts 24:26).

We all have to face battles and trials. No one else can pass through our trials for us. The hour will surely come when we must face the enemy for ourselves. Parents, pastors, and counselors may shield us from warfare for a season, but the day will come when God allows us to walk into the battle alone. He does this so that we can testify of His faithfulness-a faithfulness that we have personally observed. Another reason He allows us to face the enemy is to see whether we will obey His commands (Judges 3:4). 

Peter discovered that he had more \"mouth\" than \"might\" (Luke 22:33). As long as Jesus was around, he could really talk a good battle. However, the moment Jesus was gone, Peter denied that he even knew the Lord!

\"Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?\" This is a simple question, but God truly has a difficult time finding even one man who will be the first to take a stand against evil and injustice. 

Deborah waited for Barak to have the courage to stand up against the evil oppression of Jabin and Sisera (Judges 4). Often we cry to God for relief from the enemy, but God is waiting for us to arise and get involved in the spiritual warfare. Deborah blessed those who took the lead and willingly offered themselves (5:2). In that crucial moment when God was delivering their enemy into their hands, some, like the Reubenites, stood back. Because they were so interested in their sheep, they were very indecisive. All they had was \"great searchings of heart\" (5:16 KJV), but no action. 

It is easy to remain seated in our comfort zones and analyze why we should let someone else fight the Lord's battles. Today is the day God is defeating our enemies. Who among us will rise up first?

Gideon went through the process of learning boldness in his identity with God. \"The angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, ‘€˜Mighty hero, the Lord is with you!’ \" (Judges 6:12). Just three verses later, Gideon replied, \"But Lord . . . how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest in the whole tribe of Manasseh, and I am the least in my entire family!\" (v. 15). Gideon's natural inclination was to hide in the winepress, but his spiritual identity was that of a deliverer. After the test with the fleeces, he began to believe the report of the angel about himself. Gradually, Gideon realized that when God was with him, he could accomplish the impossible. 

Stop looking at your old identity of weakness and fear. Believe that God has called and equipped you to win your battles. Fear and timidity are just weapons the enemy uses to intimidate you. Boldly confess to the world, to the devil, and to yourself: \"I am who He says I am!\"

Essential to the most basic faith in God is the belief that He is coming. From the time of Enoch, who Genesis 5:22 declares lived \"in close fellowship with God,\" faithful believers have understood that He is coming to judge everyone (Jude 14-15). The thief on the cross was saved just by saying, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom\" (Luke 23:42). 

The Lord will return suddenly and swiftly to judge the ungodly. Just as Gideon descended with a trumpet blast in the night in sudden judgment upon Midian (Judges 7:19), Jesus will suddenly return with His saints to judge the world. If you are \"faint, yet pursuing\" 

(8:4 KJV), keep up the fight. Your blessed hope as a believer is that the Lord will return not only to deliver you from this world but also to punish His enemies who have afflicted you. 

Paul reminded the Philippian believers that \"we are citizens of heaven, where the Lord Jesus Christ lives. And we are eagerly waiting for him to return as our Savior (Philippians 3:20). . . . Remember, the Lord is coming soon\" (4:5). One day the Lord will descend from heaven, and our battle will be eternally over!

The prayer of the psalmist for God to come and change the world was a bold one. The closing hours of Jesus' life epitomized the answer to David's prayers. Jesus' slow and agonizing death on the cross caused the earth to convulse and quake. Even the sun refused to shine. The presence of the Lord was so awesome that the elements He had created were unable to function normally. 

Even the guards shook when the Lord of Life came out of the tomb (Matthew 28:4). Mighty angels confronted the women who had come to anoint Jesus' body, and Luke 24:5 says, \"The women were terrified and bowed low before them.\" 

Who can stand in the presence of almighty God? His presence will shake anything and everything until all creation acknowledges that \"the Lord reigns\" (Psalm 99:1 NIV). When God came down on Mount Sinai, the earth and mountain began to quake and shake violently, and the mountain was engulfed in fire and smoke (Exodus 19:18). 

God's kingdom is the only kingdom that cannot be shaken or destroyed (Hebrews 12:28). Let the nations tremble under the Lordship of Christ. If the earth now shakes in His absence, what will it do when He personally appears?

Satan's primary objective is to blind our eyes to the truth. Gaal could clearly see people attacking the city, but Zebul implied, \"I know you see what you think you see, but what you see is not what you think!\" 

How does Satan work? He tries to get us to deny the reality of what we see about sin until it is too late. Once the deception is complete and it is too late to reverse it, he says to us, \"Now where is that big mouth of yours? . . . Go out and fight them!\" (Judges 9:38). Satan will mock for eternity those in hell that were deceived by him. 

Jesus, on the other hand, is in the business of opening our minds. For the eleven disciples, He \"opened their minds to understand\" the Scriptures (Luke 24:45). When Jesus opens our eyes, we begin to recognize the dangers we did not even see before. \"There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death\" (Proverbs 14:12).

Rejection cuts deeply into the soul of man. To be rejected by one's own family and others can wound a person to the very core. Jephthah, son of a prostitute, knew what it was like to be rejected (Judges 11:2). His half brothers sent him away to the land of Tob simply because of his background. He had done nothing to deserve such rejection. 

Often we are rejected because of factors beyond our control. Nevertheless, the pain of rejection makes us lash out at those who have hurt us, especially when they reach out to us for help later on. Our response is frequently like Jephthah's: \"Why do you come to me now, when you're in trouble?\" (Judges 11:7). 

Jesus Christ knew the pain of rejection to the fullest. The entire nation turned its back on Him, for He was \"despised and rejected-a man of sorrows, acquainted with bitterest grief\" (Isaiah 53:3). 

Have you ever come to your friends or family with a loving witness, only to have it flung back into your face? Love them anyway. One day, like Jephthah's brethren, they will come knocking on your door. When they do, give them a glimpse of the love of Christ in you.

Samson's whole ministry resulted from the Holy Spirit's coming upon him in power (Judges 14:19). Without that power, he was weak and insignificant. Jesus' ministry also began with the power He received from His baptism in the Holy Spirit (John 1:32). How dare we think that we can enter ministry and be effective for God without the same power released in us! If the Son of God never performed a miracle or preached a sermon without that power, we certainly should wait upon the Lord for it as well. 

All ministry has its basis in the Person and power of the Holy Spirit as He enters our lives and brings us into a deeper dimension. The Holy Spirit stirred Samson. This stirring literally means \"to agitate,\" \"to trouble,\" and \"to move.\" Samson was moved from the normal pattern of life and into the role of delivering Israel from the Philistines. The inward stirring and agitation of God against the oppression of the enemy is where the power of God is released. Allow the Holy Spirit to come upon you now and stir you to fulfill your destiny!

Often we become so caught up in working for God that we fail to be refreshed by God. Samson killed a thousand men with a donkey's jawbone. What a wonderful feat! However, in spite of this accomplishment, he cried out, \"Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of these pagan people?\" (v. 18). In other words, Samson had worked hard for God, but now he needed refreshing.  

You may be mightily used of God in deliverance and yet be perishing from spiritual thirst. A burned-out minister is worthless to the Lord, regardless of his ministerial abilities. But God will hear your cry, like He did Samson's, and open up a supernatural spring for you. Verse 19 says, \"Samson was revived as he drank.\" The psalmist said, \"He fills my life with good things. My youth is renewed like the eagle's!\" (Psalm 103:5). Refreshing and renewal take place whenever you bless the Lord with all your soul.  

Elijah killed the prophets of Baal and then was ready the next day to die and go to heaven. What is the secret of longevity in ministry and spiritual service? Lay down the \"jawbone\" every evening. Don't pick it up again the next day until you have been to the refreshing fountain of worship!

How easily the flesh can concoct a religious scheme that appears to please God but in reality is a foolish spectacle! The Levite left the proper place of worship at the tabernacle and went out as a hired \"priest\" for an idol worshiper. 

Religion drifts away from God and toward idolatry because of the love of power and money. The further religion deviates from God's Word, the more accepted it is by society. Flesh gives birth to flesh, and soon a system of religion is developed that has nothing to do with the Word of God. \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit\" (John 3:6 KJV). 

Jesus taught Nicodemus that knowing God was as simple as the Holy Spirit's giving him a new birth (v. 8). Yet Nicodemus, in his human mind, wanted to make it more complicated. Our minds long to do something religious to earn salvation. If earning salvation is hard, you can be sure it's the plan of man. If it is simple, it's the truth of God. 

Everyone can easily receive God's salvation, for it is available to all. Don't try to find God with your natural mind. Instead, follow the way of the Spirit!

Is it possible to be doing the right thing and still seem to be losing the battle? The Lord himself had commissioned the men of Israel, saying, \"Go out and fight against them\" (Judges 20:23). The Israelites' battle was in retaliation for Benjamin's wickedness. You would think that God would have instantly given the Israelites victory. Instead, they were defeated twice before they finally prevailed! 

How important it is not to interpret one lost battle as meaning that God is not with you! Satan may win a battle, but he won't win the war. You are fighting the Lord's battles, not your own. Casualties often occur in war, but victory is sure to come to the one who keeps inquiring of the Lord. Once, then twice, then a third time, the Israelites regrouped and sought the Lord. They knew their cause was just and that the war was not over until they had won. 

Never doubt in the darkness what God told you in the light. If God told you to do something for Him, it will succeed. He knows the enemy's strategy and will give you the victory in the end!

The truth of this verse is illustrated in the lives of two women, Naomi and Ruth, who were delivered from spiritual darkness. In spite of all her problems, Naomi directed Ruth toward following the true and living God (Ruth 1:22). Naomi was a real witness to Ruth, because a true witness is always kind to the outcasts. 

Ruth was a Moabitess, and God had cursed her people for fighting against Moses. As a result, they could not enter the house of God until the tenth generation (Deuteronomy 23:3). Naomi's witness to Ruth ultimately led to Ruth's marriage into the ancestral line of Jesus. The \"outcast\" became a \"princess\"! 

Jesus was a truthful witness in His discussion with the woman at the well. He told her that she needed to repent of her five marriages and present adulterous relationship (John 4:18). Others may have talked about her, but only Jesus was truthful with her. His simple statement of truth set her free, and she received the Living Water.

What would we do without the \"handfuls of purpose,\" which the Lord of the harvest intentionally leaves out for us? If Boaz had not instructed his men to drop some daily provision for Ruth, she and Naomi would have perished. 

When our lives seem insignificant and full of drudgery and routine, we must remember that God has things working for us which we never imagined. Just when Ruth's back felt like it was breaking and her bread bag was empty, she found a generous handful of purpose. Just when we think God has forgotten about us, He drops us a handful of purpose. 

Joseph was languishing in an Egyptian prison. It seemed as though God had forgotten him and his life was destined to drudgery and misery. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, God dropped Joseph a handful of purpose in the dream of Pharaoh (Psalm 105:19).  

God will drop little signs here and there to remind you of His sovereign direction and destiny for your life. Even in your struggles, all things are working together for good because you are called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28). Never forget: \"Boaz\" has his eyes upon you!

When the Israelites came out of Egypt, they were all miraculously healed of their infirmities, diseases, and slavery-related injuries. All walked out under their own power, and not a one faltered. Imagine the scope of such a miracle! Just by eating the Passover lamb, a nation of beaten, bruised, malnourished slaves received total, perfect health. 

This miracle was a type of the healing purchased at Calvary by the Passover Lamb of God, Jesus Christ. In His ministry, He healed all who desired to be well. Jesus asked the man at the pool of Bethesda, \"Would you like to get well?\" (John 5:6). The Lord's healing power was flowing to whoever would reach out and receive it.  

Can you see that healing is available to you if you will only receive it? God is no respecter of persons. What He did for Israel, He will do for you.

Eli had a hard time disciplining his sons because he was more concerned about their opinion of him than God's opinion of him. So God asked him, \"Why do you honor your sons more than me-for you and they have become fat from the best offerings of my people!\" 

(1 Samuel 2:29). 

Christians should value God's Word and His opinion far more than they value the opinion of man. Jesus rebuked the Jews because they made no effort to obtain the true praise that comes only from God. Instead, they were more concerned about receiving praise from one another (John 5:44). 

Someone once said, \"Never be concerned about what others think about you, because they don't think about you!\" In reality, most people really think primarily about themselves, and their opinions will not count when you stand before almighty God. The day will come when all men will be silent, and you alone will give an account for your choices and convictions. Where will your fans or critics be then?  

If you place God's opinion above all else, it may cost you a friend. However, at the final judgment, all eternity will record your integrity before Him. Stand firm in the truth, and honor God above anyone else, even family.

Are you a disciple of Philip or a disciple of Andrew? There were obvious differences in their answers when Jesus asked both of them what they should do about the hungry multitude. His question was merely a test of their faith. 

Philip saw the facts. His whole perspective was intellectual and negative, without any regard for spiritual vision. Anyone can rehearse the facts to God, but the facts aren't important to Him-He made the facts! Like Philip, the Israelites tested God's patience on their journey through the wilderness (Psalm 106:14). They could see only the facts: no food, no water, and no meat. But Jesus was there all the time, ready to provide for whatever needs they had.  

Andrew, on the other hand, saw the vision. He had a spiritual and positive perspective that allowed God to work miracles. Jesus is with you in the wilderness, and you, like Andrew, can believe in Him for miracles. He already knows what wonders He wants to perform on your behalf. 

Will you be a disciple of Philip or of Andrew?

God knows what rejection feels like because it happened to Him! An entire nation chose an earthly king over the privilege of having its government rest upon the shoulders of almighty God. Even in the New Testament, many who followed Jesus did so only for what He gave them to eat (John 6:34). They rejected His identity but wanted whatever benefits they could receive from Him. How that must have hurt Him! To be generous, loving, and giving to people and then be passed over as they choose someone else hurts deeply. The more love and resources we have given, the more it hurts.  

Why would anyone embrace a human source and reject God? Jesus told those following Him, \"I am the bread of life\" (John 6:35). He is our source of acceptance and satisfaction forever. He knows exactly how it feels to be rejected. After a lifetime of love and giving, He was \"despised and rejected\" (Isaiah 53:3 KJV). When He was on the cross, the crowds mocked Him and turned their backs on Him.  

Have you been rejected? Jesus knows the feeling of your infirmities (Hebrews 4:15). Run to Him and let His nail-pierced hands embrace you in perfect acceptance.

Samuel's anointing of Saul provides insight into the nature of God's anointing. The first thing that happened to Saul was that \"God changed his heart\" (v. 9). Samuel had told him, \"You will be changed into a different person\" (v. 6), and that is just what happened. The anointing of God upon your life changes you from \"glory to glory\" into the image of Jesus (2 Corinthians 3:18 KJV). Normally, you may be timid, but under the anointing, you will find yourself very bold. 

Second, the anointing caused Saul to prophesy and worship (1 Samuel 10:10). The Holy Spirit will help you to worship God with your spirit and not just with your mind. Under the anointing, you might prophesy, like Saul did. Such prophecy comes up out of your spirit and produces a stronger word from God than your intellect could produce.  

Finally, the anointing brought Saul a holy anger and power against the works of darkness (1 Samuel 11:6). A righteous indignation rose up within him, and he suddenly challenged the people to follow him to destroy the Ammonites.  

Open your spirit today for fresh anointing. Then get ready to move into a new level of change, worship, and power!

With these words, Jesus addressed His brothers who were pressuring Him to go to Jerusalem and perform miracles. They reasoned that anyone who wanted to be a public figure needed to go to the center of attention and promote himself. In their minds, Jesus had the greatest miracle show going and needed to advertise it! 

Jesus countered His brothers' demands with a reference to His time. He was committed to waiting upon the Lord for the right time with regard to doors of ministry. Many Christians, however, are more like Jesus' brothers than like Him.  They look at ministry like it's a business, and they grow frustrated if they or anyone else misses an opportunity.  

Saul, too, had no sense of divine timing (1 Samuel 13:11-12). Instead of waiting for Samuel to make the sacrifice, he forced himself to offer it before the people began to scatter. This mistake of timing cost him his throne.  

The great eagle digs his claws into the top of the rock and waits for the thermal winds. When they are blowing too hard to resist, he releases his talons and soars. His wings do not flap with exertion, but he effortlessly soars high. Wait for the Lord and His winds of opportunity. He will exalt you when the timing is perfect.

How much can God do with one person? Very often we know that something should be done, but we are waiting on others to do it. Jonathan and his armor bearer were sitting in an impossible situation, between two steep, sharp, and rocky cliffs (1 Samuel 14:4). They were literally between a rock and a hard place!  

While everyone waited on someone else to make a move, Jonathan believed that one plus God is a majority. In essence, He said, \"Let's go! The Lord can take care of us whether we face many or few.\" In his impossible situation, Jonathan was confident of God's saving power. 

Verse 15 of 1 Samuel 14 says, \"Suddenly, panic broke out in the Philistine army. . . . And just then an earthquake struck, and everyone was terrified.\" Who do you think sent the panic and the earthquake in response to Jonathan's faith? God, of course! 

God is really looking for just one person who will step out in faith, and when He finds that person, He starts to move. What if you are that person? Take the first step, make your move, and watch God make His move!

To obey is better than sacrifice. This simple statement contains the secret to pleasing God. Rebellion began with the devil's asserting his own will and making his own decisions. Saul's problems started when he no longer was small in his own eyes but, in pride, began to make decisions apart from God's will. 

Rebellion and arrogance tell us that we know more than God does and that our ways are above His ways. The Lord, however, doesn't need us to think for Him, but only to carry out what He commands. He found this trait in David, a young shepherd boy who possessed a heart to obey Him fully (1 Samuel 16:7). Because of David's pure heart, God took the kingdom from Saul and awarded it to David. 

Jesus' life was powerful because He never once asserted His own will. In the wilderness, during His ministry, at Gethsemane, and on the cross, Jesus perfectly obeyed. So, too, does our power with God rest in our obedience to Him. We must always remember this: The important thing is not that we have done something for God, but that we have done what God wanted us to do!

No greater work of the Lord is recorded in the Bible than David's slaying of Goliath. More than nine feet tall, Goliath presented the most imposing stature of any human being in history. The image of a little stripling boy walking and then running toward such a giant stirs the courage of all who read the tale. Let's note three of this story's many lessons. 

The first lesson deals with the boldness of a person who is anointed by God. Saul and all his men were scared to death of Goliath, but the young man who had been anointed by God had no sense of fear. He had no concern or worry because his trust was in the God who had always helped him. He boldly proclaimed, \"The Lord who saved me from the claws of the lion and the bear will save me from this Philistine!\" (1 Samuel 17:37). 

The second lesson concerns the methods of God. David refused Saul's bulky armor, saying only that he felt more comfortable without it. He was choosing God's methods over the methods of the world. Trust in the things of this world rather than the things of God will never bring success when facing an overwhelming battle. 

The third lesson illustrates the works of the Lord. God can take the smallest human weapons and warriors and demolish the mightiest foes. Who would have thought that five stones in the hand of a boy could bring down the mighty Goliath? 

Psalm 111:2 reminds us, \"How amazing are the deeds of the Lord! All who delight in him should ponder them.\" Run boldly toward your \"Goliath.\" He must come down in the name of the Lord!

Jesus described the devil as a murderer from the beginning of time, and this description also serves to illustrate the life of King Saul. When an evil spirit came upon Saul to possess him, he was overwhelmed with thoughts of envy and murder toward David. Time after time he tried to destroy David, even attempting to pin him to the wall with a spear (1 Samuel 18:10-11). 

Satan is envious of believers because they have replaced him as worshipers and sons of God. His hatred for humankind knows no bounds. He always seeks \"to steal and kill and destroy\" (John 10:10), and He wants to destroy you!     

Jesus said that the devil is a liar and the father of lies. Saul lied to David and told him he wanted to give his older daughter Merab in marriage to him. In fact, he wanted David killed by the Philistines (1 Samuel 18:17). David's innocence, however, was his protection. The Lord sent the Holy Spirit to knock to the ground the soldiers who chased David. Even Saul himself was knocked to the ground (19:23-24). 

Let us rejoice that even though Satan attacks with lies and murderous intents, the Holy Spirit can render our enemies harmless. We will fulfill our purposes in God!

Envy blinds us to the truth. Jonathan pleaded with his father to spare David's life, reminding him that David had done him nothing but good. Totally persuaded that David stood in the way of his son's ruling Israel, however, Saul cursed and insulted Jonathan.  

The Pharisees also were blinded by envy to the reality of the blind man's healing. They refused to believe that he had ever been blind and then refused to believe that Jesus had performed the miracle. They stubbornly refused to acknowledge that Jesus was anything but a sinner, even if He had performed the miracle (John 9:24). Jesus answered, saying, \"I have come to judge the world. I have come to give sight to the blind and to show those who think they see that they are blind\" (John 9:39). 

You will never convince those who are envious of the work of God that your motives are genuine or that God has truly performed a miracle. They will reason it away, insult you, and may even throw you out (John 9:34). They may remain blind, but one thing you will know: \"I was blind, and now I can see!\" (v. 25).

Jesus taught us that the ultimate act of love is to lay down our lives for others. In fact, Jesus stated, \"The Father loves me because I lay down my life that I may have it back again\" (John 10:17). 

People who consider the needs of others ahead of their own are true shepherds in the spirit of Jesus. On the other hand, people with hireling spirits are concerned only for what relates to their own well-being. 

Paul said, \"I have no one else like Timothy, who genuinely cares about your welfare\" (Philippians 2:20). The true love of Christ is defined in 1 John 3:16: \"We know what real love is because Christ gave up his life for us. And so we also ought to give up our lives for our Christian brothers and sisters.\" 

Just as David abandoned his own safety and went to rescue Keilah (1 Samuel 23:2), we must abandon our own self-interests and begin to lay down our lives for others. We will not lose our lives; we will take them up again!

One of the hardest lessons you may face in life is learning not to avenge yourself. In two separate instances with two different enemies, David demonstrated the importance of not taking revenge. In the cave at En-gedi, David could have killed Saul and been finished with running from him day and night. Instead, David opted against avenging Saul's evil attempts to destroy him and swore that his hand would never touch Saul. 

In another instance in the Old Testament, Abigail intercepted David and persuaded him not to avenge himself upon Nabal. David thanked her for keeping him from shedding blood that day and preventing him from taking revenge with his own hands (1 Samuel 25:33). 

How easy it is to take matters into your own hands, even though God has said, \"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord\" (Romans 12:19 KJV). The devil may have sent someone who is encouraging you to take matters into your own hands, but leave your vengeance in God's hands. One day you will look up and the \"Sauls\" and \"Nabals\" in your life \"will disappear like stones shot from a sling!\" (1 Samuel 25:29).

The world is fascinated with life after death. People spend thousands of dollars consulting psychics, trying to get a message from someone who has died. In 1 Samuel 28 and John 11, two men came back from the dead and had a great impact on those around them. In the first passage, Samuel gave Saul a verdict of judgment and eternal death, reminding us of the reality of eternal punishment. In the second passage, Lazarus' resurrection gave glory to Jesus, reminding us of the believer's glorious future.  

Every one of us will face the reality of death. We will hear either a final judgment of condemnation for our sin or a message of joy and resurrection life from the Author of Life. Although the world is fascinated with spiritism and contacting the dead, we know that the end of such pursuit is eternal death and judgment. As Christians, however, we understand that Jesus has conquered death, for John 11:25 says, 

\"Those who believe in me, even though they die like everyone else, will live again.\" 

Rest secure today in your future after the grave, for He who is the Resurrection and the Life will be waiting for you on the other side!

Just when things looked the darkest for David, God was actually giving him the breakthrough. At Ziklag, David faced the lowest point in his life, for he lost his entire family in one day. After this tragedy, even his best friends were ready to stone him. Because he found strength in the Lord, however, God turned the whole situation around.  \"David got back everything the Amalekites had taken, and he rescued his two wives. Nothing was missing: small or great, son or daughter, nor anything else that had been taken. David brought everything back\" (1 Samuel 30:18-19). 

Someone has pointed out that at Ziklag David was only seventy-two hours away from a miracle. Unknown to him, all the years of his running from Saul were about to come to an end. The test was almost over, but the final part of the test was the hardest. But afterward, not only did David recover everything, but he also gained a tremendous amount of wealth. He used that wealth to spread goodwill throughout Judah, and this initiated the process of his becoming king of Judah. What a turnabout from the deep depression of Ziklag! 

You may think you have waited forever, but you may be only seventy-two hours from your miracle. \"When Job prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his fortunes. In fact, the Lord gave him twice as much as before\" (Job 42:10). Wait for God to turn your darkness into glorious light!

Satan may try to delay, hinder, sift, oppose, and confuse, but the moment of your breakthrough must come. Although the hands of a clock move almost imperceptibly, the moment inevitably arrives when the clock strikes the hour. The poet Friedrich von Logau expressed it this way: \"Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small; though with patience He stands waiting, with exactness grinds He all.\" 

Jesus' thirty-three years of preparation and ministry culminated in the glory of His death and resurrection. In that moment, the prince of this world was cast out (John 12:31). David also experienced tremendous pressure in his years of preparation, but suddenly his hour came, Saul died unexpectedly, and the path to the throne was opened (2 Samuel 2:4). 

This is the payoff of years of faithful service to a vision: one day the hour will come. Never try to get ahead of your time, for God knows when the circumstances are ripe and you have been thoroughly prepared. All your trials and difficulties are only the stepping-stones to your glorious destiny: to reign forever with Jesus Christ!

Betrayal is one of the worst things that can happen to you. To take someone into your inner circle of confidence and then to have him turn upon you hurts worse than any enemy's attack. Jesus knew intimately this pain of betrayal as He watched Judas walk out into the night to fulfill his wicked plan (John 13:30). David also faced betrayal when his commander-in-chief Joab secretly murdered Abner (2 Samuel 3:27). 

When a trusted ally treats you with contempt, you may want to retaliate in anger. David refused to exact revenge upon Joab. He knew Joab would eventually reap the fruit of his betrayal and thus pronounced Joab cursed in all his generations. Jesus turned Judas over to Satan so that Judas would reap the terror of betraying the innocent. Instead of retaliating, Jesus even washed Judas's feet before Judas left to betray Him! On the cross, Jesus epitomized the essence of true forgiveness when He said, \"Father, forgive these people, because they don't know what they are doing\" (Luke 23:34). 

Forgive and release your betrayer to God so that He may deal with him. If God is for you, who can ever be against you (Romans 8:31)?

Worship tests our hearts. Nothing is so sacred or special to God as worship, for it is the continual activity around God's throne.  

In 2 Samuel 6, we are confronted with two individuals who came under judgment for worshiping in the wrong way. The lesson of Uzzah 

(v. 7) is to maintain reverence in our worship. Flippant, halfhearted, presumptuous worship can result in the judgment of God coming upon our lives. God is long-suffering, but He will not be mocked by open disregard for His honor during our worship. 

The lesson of Michal (v. 20) is not to be prideful in our worship. Michal despised David's true worship, and God's judgment caused her to remain childless throughout her life. David, however, was a man after God's own heart (1 Samuel 13:14) in the way he expressed worship. He was serious and careful in bringing up the ark, yet childlike and undignified in his rejoicing. 

Personal dignity is not an issue in heaven where all fall down before the throne in ceaseless praise and worship. One day we will join the angels in heaven in unashamed worship and praise to our God. As you worship Him now on the earth, remember His holiness and His happiness. Go ahead and worship in order and in ardor. God is watching your worship!

There is in the heart of all people a desire for a permanent relationship with God and a desire to dwell with Him forever. In this life, we are forever beset with a sense of impermanence, of being absent from the Lord. 

Those who love God are running to Him, not from Him! They are looking for a way to dwell with Him. David's desire to build a house for God reflected his wish to have a permanent home with God. David had such a love for God's presence that he longed for God to have a permanent residence right next door to his palace. God responded to David's yearning by saying that He would provide a place for His people and plant them so they could have a home of their own. He also told David that He would build a house for him. 

To meet someone is a temporary experience, but to live together with that person implies a permanent relationship. Jesus told His disciples, \"All those who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and live with them\" (John 14:23). 

Settle in today in God's presence. His desire is to dwell with you forever!

In this verse, we can see an example of the three main roots of sin that tempt all men: \"the lust for physical pleasure, the lust for everything we see, and pride in our possessions\" (1 John 2:16). 

Most sin begins with the eyes, just as the first sin entered the world when Eve saw the fruit. Genesis 3:6 says, \"The fruit looked so fresh and delicious.\" David's eyes caused him to lust, starting a cycle of violence and anarchy in his kingdom. His lustful eyes brought forth sin, and it cost him many years and much heartache to extricate himself from that sin. David finally said, \"I will refuse to look at anything vile and vulgar\" (Psalm 101:3). Job, too, echoed this thought when he said, \"I made a covenant with my eyes not to look with lust upon a young woman\" (Job 31:1). 

Sinful living comes with a high price tag. A line from a famous sermon conveys it well: \"Sin will take you further than you want to go, keep you longer than you want to stay, and cost you more than you want to pay.\" Be ruthless against lustful thoughts and imaginations. You may think the pleasure is great, but the payoff will only bring heartache.

Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would convict the world of guilt in regard to sin. Conviction arises from confrontation with evidence. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth, and He holds before your conscience the evidence of your sin, leaving you no room for escape. 

The prophet Nathan confronted David with a parable that illustrated David's guilt with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12:7). The simple parable smote his conscience, and David truly repented from his heart. Although his sin was great, he received forgiveness because his repentance was genuine. 

When God confronts you with the truth of your sin, He is showing mercy. As Jesus said, \"And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free\" (John 8:32). Never run from the evidence. The Holy Spirit will bring certain scriptures to you as a mirror to show you your true self. If you respond to His mercy and grace, you will be set free from whatever sin has plagued you. 

Invite the Holy Spirit to shine the light on the truth of your life and actions. Then honestly accept and admit His evidence, and confess with David, \"I have sinned against the Lord\" (2 Samuel 12:13). Then, and only then, will you hear Him say, \"Yes, but the Lord has forgiven you\" (v. 13).

Satan is a master at dangling lustful sin in front of us and making it look incredibly enticing. Then, after we reach out and take it, the reality of that sin is a miserable disappointment. How quickly our eyes despise what we have attained through lust! 

Satan tempts us with a picture of sin that looks like an oasis in the desert. He makes it seem as though a lust fulfilled will bring the ultimate happiness. Amnon fantasized for a long time about having relations with Tamar. However, the moment he acted upon his fantasy, the imagined sweet taste of it turned to bitterness. Amnon eventually despised what he had conquered (2 Samuel 13:15).  

In any temptation, ask God to show you the reality of how disappointing the sin will be. Any move you make because of lust will turn to mock you and will lead you toward even more sin. Ask for the help of the Holy Spirit to break through any fantasy in your mind and to see its backside: anger, disrespect, and even death. 

\"There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death\" (Proverbs 14:12). Don't fall for Satan's bait!

Meditation is not the process of clearing your mind, but of filling your mind with truth. It is like a rock displacing water in a vessel. Your mind is exposed continually to the doubt, atrocities, filth, and strife of the world around you. Trying to clear out those thoughts is very difficult, but there is a remedy: meditation upon God's Word. 

It takes a conscious effort to focus your mind and heart upon the truth of God's Word. Once you do, however, you will reap the benefits. Joshua 1:8 says, \"Study this Book of the Law continually. Meditate on it day and night so you may be sure to obey all that is written in it. Only then will you succeed.\" 

Reading the Bible is good, but meditation is life changing, for it involves thinking about a verse until it drops from your mind into your heart. The root word meditate means \"to mutter,\" or \"to utter.\" The more you speak the Word, the more it drops into your spirit. As you go about your daily business, speak the Word to yourself. Continually \"mutter\" it, mulling it over in your mind. 

Whatever your area of need, select several promises that apply to your situation and memorize them. Then meditate on them all day long (Psalm 119:97). When doubt, fear, discouragement, and strife enter your mind, \"think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise\" (Philippians 4:8). Your faith will grow, your mind will change, and your way will become successful!

The psalmist declares a holy revulsion that must dwell in your heart against anything that challenges the law of God. If you consistently struggle to conquer an area of sin in your life, it may be that you do not hate that sin. 

One sin God hates is divorce (Malachi 2:16), not because He wants to be legalistic but because He knows the terrible consequences you will suffer from it. Satan's deception concerning this sin and all sin is so devious and the consequences of disobedience so eternal that you must develop a passion against all sin, for it destroys people's souls.  

Double-minded or undecided people (Psalm 119:113) are those who mix God's law with their own reasoning, listening to the voice of personal opinion rather than the voice of truth. Such compromisers lead the godly astray and are unstable in all their ways (James 1:8). If you are double-minded, rid yourself of lukewarmness, and purify your heart. 

If you don't hate sin, you will fall into it. Love God and hate sin, and you will always walk in the path of righteousness.

Though he was very rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty he could make you rich\" (2 Corinthians 8:9). Jesus completely emptied Himself of all earthly riches and glory in order to pay the full price for our redemption. How opposite His attitude was from that of a world that struggles to amass wealth and fortune!  

Let us live to give. In the short time we are on earth, let us use our worldly possessions as tools to reach the lost. At the moment of death, we will discard all earthly goods, like an animal shedding a worn-out skin. Let's take a fresh look at our possessions and ask how they can serve to further the Gospel before God calls us home to glory!

When grown men run, something urgent has caused them to abandon their usual dignity. Ahimaaz's zeal to run was inspired by his joy at being the one to report a victory to his king (2 Samuel 18:28). In the New Testament, Peter and John ran at the thought of the resurrection (John 20:4). When we have an important message to deliver, we, too, will run. 

When news so wonderful grips the soul, the usual pace of life is interrupted, and a walk becomes a run. Those who do not know the Lord may not understand your zeal to run with the good news of the Gospel, but they do not hesitate to run for what they are excited about. You need to ask God to quicken your pace of testimony, to thrill your heart with His Word so that a walk just won't do. 

If you have lost your zeal, come back to the empty tomb today and look in. Then run to the waiting nations with your report. Remember what Jesus said when He appeared to His disciples following His resurrection: \"As the Father has sent me, so I send you\" (John 20:21).

The return of the king was a sudden, unanticipated event that radically changed all perspectives. Those who had mocked David as he left Jerusalem now repented, falling prostrate and begging for mercy. Those who had blessed David in his exile were richly rewarded (2 Samuel 19:23) and invited to sit at his table for the rest of their lives. With his return, David held accountable those whose actions were questionable, and the truth was revealed (v. 25). 

What a picture this story is of the return of the King of Kings! When Jesus returns, time will stop. One by one, we will each stand before the judgment seat of Christ and give a detailed account of how we have used our time, money, and gifts. We will answer for every wrong thought and attitude of the mind we have harbored. 

How foolish it is to waste our lives or brazenly defy the Lordship of Christ as though He will never return! Why not ponder every day what it will be like the moment after the King returns and it is too late to change anything? One day our King will return. That is a sure fact. May you hear Him say, \"Well done, my good and faithful servant\" (Matthew 25:21).

We must take care of unfinished business. God is a God of justice and cannot overlook the horrible reality of sin. Saul killed people with whom Israel had pledged a covenant in the days of Joshua. Though Saul viewed the killings as justifiable, the victims' innocent blood cried out before God, demanding justice. The heavens remained as brass for David and Israel until they dealt with and atoned for Saul's actions. 

Many things occur in societies because God is avenging past actions and atrocities that were leveled against innocent people. What generational curses have fallen upon our cities and nations because of the past sins of our fathers? 

In 2 Samuel 24, we see that God was so serious about justice that seventy thousand people died to appease His wrath (v. 15). We must be serious enough about sins against others to cry out in repentance, approach the offended, and make reconciliation. These actions, as simple as they may seem, will release the blessing of God. As David did, we must help restore and heal the breaches of the past, because after he had made restitution, \"the Lord answered his prayer\" (v. 25).

What a picture of the conquering power of God we see as David rehearsed the exploits of his mighty men (2 Samuel 23)! One of them killed eight hundred men (v. 8), and others killed hundreds singlehandedly. Three of them broke through an entire army to bring David a drink of water (v. 16). One killed a lion in a pit and snatched a spear from a giant (vv. 20-21).  

Oh, the mighty exploits of those who are filled with the holy power of God! After he was baptized in the Holy Spirit, Peter's boldness in the face of hostile Jerusalem was just as awesome as the courage of David's mighty men. 

Away with weak, cowardly Christianity! Let us yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit and prepare for triumphant battle with the enemy. We are the mighty men and women of the Holy Spirit under the New Covenant. 

Our power is not intended for destruction, but for reconciliation. Our victory will not be a military victory, but a harvest of souls. \"Those who believed what Peter said were baptized and added to the church-about three thousand in all\" (Acts 2:41).

David was in a mess. He had done a foolish thing when he tempted the Lord by counting his fighting men. God gave him three choices of judgment, and they all sounded bad! David wisely chose the option that involved God's mercy, for he said, \"But let us fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercy is great. Do not let me fall into human hands\" (2 Samuel 24:14). 

The man at the gate Beautiful looked at thousands of people every day as he begged for financial mercies. Peter addressed the man, saying, \"Look at us!\" (Acts 3:4).

David knew what he was talking about, for he had faced one close call after another during his lifetime. Near the end of his life, he faced the ultimate snare: an insurrection in which one of his own rebellious sons attempted to usurp the throne from David's chosen heir. But God always provides a way of escape! The plot drew the attention of Nathan, and in a swift series of events, the plan of the rebels was foiled and Solomon was installed as king. 

The apostles also escaped from a snare set against them. The Sanhedrin rulers were furious with the apostles for healing the cripple. They purposed to beat them, jail them, or threaten them in some way. Instead, the Lord delivered them, restored them to their friends, and filled them with the Holy Spirit (Acts 4:23-31).

How well the characters in today's readings bear out this scripture! Adonijah requested his father's concubine, a move that would have brought him much political power. Solomon answered that request by having Adonijah and his cohort Joab put to death (1 Kings 2:13-34). 

Shimei disobeyed the clear instructions of Solomon to remain in the physical vicinity of Jerusalem. Shimei thought his disobedience in taking a little side trip to Gath would go unnoticed, but Solomon also had him put to death (1 Kings 2:36-46). 

Ananias and Sapphira thought that a little deception concerning the sale price of their land would go unnoticed. However, they discovered that God does not judge us by what we think is right, but by what He declares to be right. God's judgment struck swiftly and left them both dead (Acts 5:1-10). 

The devil is constantly filling our minds with little compromises that we must discern as evil. Our thoughts must line up with the measuring rod of God's Word. If they don't, we must run from them, because they will lead to certain death!

Wisdom is the most powerful force in the world-a force greater than riches, power, or long life. Solomon realized that without wisdom his youthfulness and lack of experience would quickly disqualify him from leading a nation of millions of people. He therefore asked God, \"Give me an understanding mind so that I can govern your people well and know the difference between right and wrong. For who by himself is able to govern this great nation of yours?\" (1 Kings 3:9). 

God was pleased with Solomon's request and granted him not only wisdom but also riches, honor, and long life. Because of his great wisdom, the kings and queens of the entire earth came before Solomon's throne. His God-given wisdom enabled him to efficiently administrate the kingdom by using twelve district governors. Furthermore, he knew the solution to difficult problems of justice in civil disputes (v. 28). 

Solomon's wisdom extended into the natural world, too. \"He composed some 3,000 proverbs and wrote 1,005 songs. He could speak with authority about all kinds of plants, from the great cedar of Lebanon to the tiny hyssop that grows from cracks in a wall. He could also speak about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish\" (1 Kings 4:32-33). 

Peter and the apostles realized that if people were \"well respected\" and \"full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom\" (Acts 6:3), they could be placed in positions of responsibility. Today, in faith, ask God for wisdom to enter your heart. Then watch as He promotes you to new responsibility and privilege in the eyes of both God and humanity!

Solomon had a vision to build the most magnificent temple in history, and his success resulted from the blessing of the Lord. First, the Lord gave Solomon wisdom to achieve his purpose (1 Kings 5:12). He showed him how to rotate his labor force in such a way that the men could be in Lebanon one month and at home for two months. Shared responsibility, as indicated by rotating the labor force, was a wise plan from God to cover responsibilities without burning out the laborers. 

Second, Solomon achieved success because he followed the plan of the Lord (1 Kings 6:12). You cannot hope to succeed at any work for God if you deviate from the revelation in the Bible. All work must follow the exact plan of the Church as given in the Gospels, Acts, and the Epistles. 

Finally, Solomon succeeded because he persevered. He spent seven years building the temple (1 Kings 6:38), never wavering from his goal. Never give up when God is \"building\" with you. Though it may seem your work is moving at a crawl, keep doing what you know to do. 

Purpose, plan, and persevere, and the Lord will build your house!

Solomon's temple was indeed magnificent when one considers the brass, the silver, and the gold contained within it. For seven years men crafted the temple, with no budget considerations and an unlimited source of building materials. This house was the most magnificent edifice ever created by any human being, before or since. 

For all the beauty and greatness of Solomon's house, however, \"the Most High doesn't live in temples made by human hands\" (Acts 7:48). To think that God would be tied down to any building, temple, denomination, or culture is ridiculous! We are not building an earthly temple for God, but a spiritual temple. God has chosen to live in human hearts, and the temple we are constructing is made of living stones (1 Peter 2:5)- believers from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation. 

Someone once told a story of three men who were working side-by-side laying brick. When asked, \"What are you doing?\" one answered, \"Laying brick.\" Another answered, \"Raising a wall.\" The last answered, \"Building a great cathedral.\"  

Lord, give us spiritual vision to see that we are building the greatest temple in the universe: the Church of Jesus Christ!

In 1 Kings 8:11, God's presence so permeated the atmosphere in the magnificent temple that \"the priests could not continue their work because the glorious presence of the Lord filled the Temple.\" After the celebration of the Festival of Shelters that followed the dedication of Solomon's temple, the people of Jerusalem were \"joyful and happy because the Lord had been good to his servant David and to his people Israel\" (1 Kings 8:66).

Money does not satisfy. Had it satisfied the queen of Sheba, she never would have traveled for hundreds of miles over ancient roads and deserts just to hear the words of God from Solomon. The human heart craves more than money. It craves answers to life's purpose and longs to see the wisdom and power of God. 

Simon was willing to pay money to obtain the power of laying hands on people to receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:18-19). The treasurer for Candace, the queen of Ethiopia, was more interested in knowing whom Isaiah was describing than he was in acquiring all the wealth of which he was steward (v. 34). Even Solomon with his hundreds of talents of gold per year was not satisfied with worldly wealth, and his wandering, searching heart thus delved into idolatry. 

Don't let the devil dangle riches before your eyes, telling you that money will fulfill you. Those who have handled vast sums of it will tell you otherwise. Use money as a tool to evangelize the world, and enjoy the free riches of the Kingdom of God!

How can we explain God's choices? In John 15:16, Jesus said, \"You didn't choose me. I chose you.\" Saul was the last person we would have expected God to select as an instrument to tell the world about Jesus. But we know from 1 Corinthians 1:27 that God deliberately chooses \"things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise.\" In choosing Saul as a divine instrument, God certainly knew that his testimony would totally confound the Jews. 

Jeroboam, another of God's unlikely choices, was equally surprised when the prophet Ahijah informed him of his future destiny as the king of Israel (1 Kings 11:29). In a moment, because of God's sovereign selection, the entire course of his life was altered. 

You may never figure out the ways of God in laying His hand on seemingly unworthy vessels in order to glorify Himself. Yet if you are a Christian, you are chosen. If you are chosen, you are ordained. If you are ordained, you will produce fruit (John 15:16). 

Relax, and carry out your calling!

This remarkable prophecy reminds us of the foreknowledge of God, for King Josiah of Judah was not born until nearly three hundred years after the word of the Lord had foretold it! Imagine if someone on the Mayflower had announced the exact name of a recently elected American president and had described in detail his policies and actions. Such a scenario would be similar to what happened with Josiah, for he fulfilled the prophecy concerning his life down to the smallest detail (2 Kings 23:15-16). 

Our lives are not accidental, but are carefully purposed by God to bring glory to His name. We are indeed children of destiny. The Lord told Jeremiah, \"I knew you before I formed you in your mother's womb. Before you were born I set you apart and appointed you as my spokesman to the world\" (Jeremiah 1:5). Rest today in the foreknowledge of God concerning your destiny. From the beginning of time, God has had His eye upon you!

The spiritual gift of the word of knowledge enabled both Peter and Ahijah (1 Kings 14:5) to know the purpose of their household visitors. Without a direct revelation from the Holy Spirit, neither of these men would have had any idea who their guests were or why they were visiting. 

The Holy Spirit knows all things and occasionally releases into our minds critical information that does not come from our own investigative powers. How miraculous it was for the blind prophet Ahijah not to be fooled by a masquerading queen! Instead, he called the queen by name and told her the reason she had come. He even gave an accurate prediction of her son's imminent death, which came to pass exactly as he had said (1 Kings 14:12, 17). 

Let us reverence the Holy Spirit's gifts, for they are incredible tools that enable us to know both the circumstances and the motives of human hearts. Also, because He knows us as well as He knew Ahijah's and Peter's visitors, it would be well for us to keep our own lives pure!

Someone has called Elijah's journey the place called there. During the three and one-half years of drought, God always directed him to go there. God commanded a widow to feed him there (1 Kings 17:9). There is an exact place where God wants us to be so He can sustain and bless us. 

Peter found the place called there when he was obedient and went to the house of Cornelius. Peter, like Elijah, was instructed to go to the home of a Gentile. This was the opposite of what they had been taught in their Jewish upbringing. 

The place called there may not be the place we would naturally choose. However, it is the place where there is the greatest hunger. A desperately hungry widow and a spiritually hungry centurion both received the blessing from a man of God directed to their homes. As someone once said, \"Where God guides, He provides.\" We must endeavor to always remain in the place called there.

The truth of this scripture was demonstrated in Elijah's powerful confrontation with the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). First, God sent the drought to draw the people into the arena of decision. Then, He sent the fire to convince them of their sin. Finally, He sent the rain to remind them of His blessing. 

God is able to do \"whatever pleases Him,\" at whatever time it pleases Him. When God was ready to visit the Gentiles, He did whatever pleased Him! But Peter had to spend time trying to convince the Jerusalem eldership that God was the Author of the Cornelius visitation (Acts 11:4). 

He is a mighty God, and His power can flow in whatever direction His love desires. Get out of the way and let God move! The result will be as it was in Acts 11:21 NIV: \"The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people turned and believed in the Lord.\"

The One who remembers us in our times of trouble also remembered Elijah and Peter at their lowest points. Elijah was suffering from burnout after fighting the victorious battle on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 19:4), but an angel of the Lord came and strengthened him. God gave him new vision and direction for his life. Peter, also in dire straits, had an angelic visitation and was rescued from prison the night before he was to be executed. 

You can learn from these examples that God remembers you in your human frailty when you are worn-out in mind, body, and spirit from the fatigue of spiritual warfare. When you are at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on. Help is on the way!

Oh, the power of prophetic confrontation! Since earliest times, kings and leaders of nations have been challenged by the miracles and rebukes of anointed prophets. Ahab was shown a miraculous sign when God delivered the Arameans into his hands. Then Elijah confronted Ahab in Naboth's vineyard as God judged him for Naboth's murder (1 Kings 21:17). The proconsul Sergius Paulus witnessed a powerful miracle when God struck the sorcerer blind (Acts 13:11). These confrontational miracles were intended to demonstrate to those in authority that God is Lord of heaven and earth. 

In Christ you have the authority to confront those in leadership with the claims of Christ. No power is greater than God, and He has given you power so you might bring the Gospel to world leaders. The same Spirit that filled Paul and blinded Elymas (Acts 13:9) is in you. Don't be afraid, but speak boldly. God will surely back you up!

Compromise is the price a person is willing to pay to a false god. That was Jehoshaphat's problem. In an effort to promote peace and unity, he was willing to ally himself with Ahab, a man who was vile and wicked before God (1 Kings 22:4). 

People often compromise because of a desire to be socially accepted. They overlook glaring abuses of God's Word in order to maintain relationships. Micaiah, however, refused to compromise or make even one small concession to Ahab's false religious system. He was willing to endure physical attack and imprisonment just to maintain the witness of truth against Ahab (1 Kings 22:17, 22-24). Although confined in prison, Micaiah was safer than was Jehoshaphat, who almost lost his life in the brief battle that ensued. 

Look at the end result of compromise, and settle in your mind that you owe no allegiance to the idols of this world. They and their worshipers will one day perish with the same fate as Ahab's!

God's miracles always start with the question, What do you have? The little boy with five loaves and two fish provided the only resource for Jesus to bless and feed the five thousand. The widow who fed Elijah during the famine possessed only a little meal and a little oil as a resource. The common thread in both these miracles is that faith was mixed with a few small things offered to God. 

If you have a need, you must first put something into God's hand for Him to work with and multiply back to you. We call this seed sowing, or placing into the soil of faith some object that we \"lose\" in order that God may multiply it into a harvest.  

Don't wait for God to supply your need-use what you have! God asked Moses, \"What do you have there in your hand?\" (Exodus 4:2), and the rod became the means of Israel's deliverance from Egypt. Give your resources to God, and watch Him multiply them for your deliverance!

Naaman's young servant girl had no idea how important her little remark to his wife would be in bringing about her master's deliverance from leprosy. God often uses the faith of others to start the cycle of healing and deliverance when a person is unable to start it for himself. 

The four men who brought the paralytic to Christ and let him down through the roof were the direct agents of their friend's healing (Mark 2:3). Perhaps you can \"hold the rope\" for some sick friend who has no knowledge of (or hope for) healing. Though this person may not realize the importance of believing God's healing promises, you must remain convinced that God is the answer. 

The little servant girl risked her life to confirm assuredly to Naaman's wife that if her husband went to the prophet in Samaria, he would cure him of leprosy. This bold statement of faith started the cycle of Naaman's deliverance and ended with his flesh becoming as clean as the flesh of a young boy. 

In whose life could your faith make a difference today?

The story of the lost ax head is so descriptive of the human condition. First, the ax head was not with its rightful master. In the same way, we once belonged to God, but Satan stole us in the Garden of Eden and made us his slaves. 

Second, the ax head was in the wrong place. It should have been out doing its work, but instead it was on the bottom of the Jordan in an alien environment. When we were in sin, we were completely submerged in the wrong environment-dead to God and alienated from His life. 

Finally, the ax head could not save itself. The ax head had no power to change its situation; thus, it was destined to remain stuck in the mud. Only when \"Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water\" (2 Kings 6:6) did the ax head supernaturally begin to rise from the bottom in a physical \"resurrection.\" What a picture of Jesus' death and resurrection! 

No amount of personal desire or willpower can lift us from the muddy quagmire of sin if we are stuck fast in it. Only Jesus can deliver us. We then belong to God, never to return to the bottom again!

Household salvation is a promise stated throughout the Word of God. Paul told the Philippian jailer that if he gave his heart to Jesus, he and his family would be saved. That night both he and his entire family became Christians (Acts 16:34). At that moment, all their names were recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life. 

As the children of Israel waited for judgment to fall upon their nation, they were instructed to offer a lamb for a household (Exodus 12:3). We should never stop pressing this claim of the Word of God for our families to be saved from the wrath to come.  

We must daily bring our families and relatives before the Father. Noah entered the ark with his entire family. Job prayed continually for his children, in case one of them had done something to offend God. It pleases the Lord when we remind Him of our kindred relationship to our families and stand against Satan's attempts to totally defeat them. 

Place the blood of Jesus daily over the doorpost of your household. Claim today that all your household will join you in heaven and will bring you joy here on earth as well!

We are locked into a spiritual battle over areas of our lives that the enemy seeks to control, including our families, our finances, and our safety. But God gives us the strength and ability to skillfully confront and win every battle that rages against us. 

David understood the principles of both spiritual and natural warfare; consequently, he fought his battles with not only the sword but also praise and worship. The results of his victory in spiritual warfare are evident in Psalm 144: blessings to his sons and daughters.

God wants to bless you, but until you learn spiritual warfare, you will live under the enemy's curse. You may be begging and pleading with God for blessing, while all the time the thief is actually stealing your inheritance and blessings! 

Begin today to praise and worship the Lord for the victory won for you at the cross and through the resurrection. Focus on your position in the heavenlies (Ephesians 2:6), and demand that the devil loose your family, finances, and security. Your blessings must release. You may have to fight for a while, but the victory is assured if you persevere!

How beautifully this principle is illustrated in the lives of Joash and Paul! Little Joash, at only seven years of age, was defenseless against the ruthless Queen Athaliah. \"Joash and his nurse remained hidden in the Temple of the Lord for six years while Athaliah ruled over the land\" (2 Kings 11:3). Only the Lord could have kept him from crying at the wrong moment or being seen by someone who was friendly to the queen. Athaliah finally met her death, the Lord fulfilling His promise to destroy the wicked. 

Paul faced great danger from the Jews at Corinth. \"One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision and told him, ‘Don't be afraid! Speak out! Don't be silent! For I am with you, and no one will harm you because many people here in this city belong to me' \" (Acts 18:9-10). The Jews' efforts to bring legal action against Paul ended in their being thrown out of court in one moment of time. 

Satan makes you think the end is here, the worst has come, and the game is lost. Remember: It's not over until it's over. The Lord is watching over you!

The power of God is tangible! Elisha had been buried for an undetermined period of time when another dead man was accidentally thrown into his grave. Elisha's bones had so much of the power of God still residing in them that they caused the dead man to resurrect. And to think, we have trouble raising the dead while we are still alive! 

Paul's body also contained great power from God. Even handkerchiefs that he had touched could be taken to the sick to bring healing (Acts 19:11-12). Obviously, Jesus carried this power, too. People could touch the hem of His garment and be completely healed. 

In each of these cases, the power of God inhabited the physical world and was able to be transmitted. Why should we think it strange that God's supernatural, miracle-working power can break into the physical world and change even the most desperate of circumstances? 

If we are filled with the Holy Spirit, this same power is in us. We must exercise it to minister justice to the oppressed, provide food for the hungry, and bring freedom to the captives (Psalm 146:7).

Satan's ugly, violent acts of horror are graphically painted throughout the Old Testament. We find monarchs murdered, pregnant women mutilated, and children sacrificed in fire (2 Kings 15:16, 16:3). We see idolatry in its basest form with the establishment of demonic altars in the temple of God (2 Kings 16:10-14). 

In the New Testament, we find Jewish exorcists helpless before the violent power of demon spirits. One man possessed by an evil spirit overcame the seven sons of Sceva, taunting, \"I know Jesus, and I know Paul. But who are you?\" (Acts 19:15). We see that many people in Ephesus lived under demonic oppression and practiced magic before coming to Christ (v. 19). In fact, so steeped in idolatry was Ephesus that the entire city ranted and raved against Paul and rose up to defend the honor of the false goddess Artemis (v. 27).  

We cannot deny that Satan has spread his unclean message across all cultures and throughout all history. The good news is that we are not of his kingdom! We are those to whom the Lord grants peace and satisfaction. 

Claim the peace of God for your life, and allow no trace of Satan's kingdom to penetrate!

From this verse in Acts, we get \"20/20 vision\"! Paul reminded the Ephesian elders that his message had been consistent everywhere he had gone, both in public forums and to individuals in their own homes. He did not confine his ministry only to open, public services, but he also went into homes. This was the pattern of ministry for the early Church.   

The second part of 20/20 vision was Paul's declaration for men to turn to God in repentance and have faith in Christ Jesus (Acts 20:21). The message was twofold: repent and believe. This was the pattern of preaching for the early Church. When we stray from the simplicity of this message, we will not be effective in reaching a godless, confused society. 

The final part of Paul's 20/20 vision was the pattern for commitment. Knowing he was facing trouble and death in Jerusalem, he still said, \"My life is worth nothing unless I use it for doing the work assigned me by the Lord Jesus-the work of telling others the Good News about God's wonderful kindness and love\" (Acts 20:24). This was the pattern of sacrifice for the early Church. Christians were willing to die to reach the world with the message of salvation. 

Have you checked your 20/20 vision lately?

What is it about praise that is so powerful? Why are we so strongly exhorted in so many scriptures to praise the Lord? 

First, praise blesses God. When His people praise His name with dancing and make music to Him with tambourine and harp, the Lord takes delight in them (Psalm 149:4). We bless Him when we dance, clap, rejoice, and are glad in Him. The saints should ever \"rejoice in his honor\" and \"sing for joy as they lie on their beds\" (v. 5). 

Second, praise engages mighty warfare against the enemy. If it is our honor to praise the Lord, then it is our glory to put our enemies to flight through praise (v. 9). Praise has the power \"to bind their kings with shackles and their leaders with iron chains\" (v. 8). As we praise God, the sentence upon our enemies as written in the Word of God is executed. 

Never underestimate the power of praise. King Hezekiah's simple worship and prayer brought the angel of the Lord into his situation. In one night, the angel killed 185,000 Assyrian troops, and Judah was delivered from the enemy's hands (2 Kings 19:35). 

Praise ye the Lord!

In the midst of the terrible ordeals of life, we often don't know to whom we can turn. In 2 Kings 20, Hezekiah was facing death because a terrible sickness had attacked his body. To whom did he turn in his hour of need? The Word of God tells us that \"he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord\" (v. 2). 

The \"wall\" represents the tower of the Lord. In his moment of desperate need, Hezekiah's eyes were no longer fixed on human methods and reports. The things of the world no longer distracted his vision. Rather, he raced to safety inside the tower of the Lord. 

The Lord heard his cry and instructed Isaiah to have Hezekiah's servants apply an ointment made from figs. They obeyed his command, and Hezekiah was healed. Because he had run to God, God heard his prayer, saw his tears, and added fifteen years to his life (vv. 5-6). 

The tower of the Lord is a supernatural tower. It is so strong that it can turn the sun backward ten degrees, a feat that boggles the mind when the laws of physics are considered. Leave your present fears behind and run into the tower of the Lord. It is the one place you are safe!

The Word of God is the one factor in your life that will determine your level of blessing. David wrote that the person whose delight is in the law of the Lord would find that whatever he does prospers (Psalm 1:2-3).

Jehoiachin's life is a tremendous picture of God's judgment and grace. His sin landed him in a dungeon for thirty-seven years; then suddenly without explanation the king sent for him and released him from prison. More favor was extended to him through kind words, a position of honor, daily food at the king's table, and a regular allowance for the rest of his life. 

In the same way, God reached down into the dark prison house of sin, and by grace He instantly released us from our sentence. He cleaned us up, spoke His love to us, and seated us \"with him in the heavenly realms\" (Ephesians 2:6). He dressed us in the finest robes of righteousness and continues to feed us each day with living bread from the table of the Word of God. Finally, He provides for all our material needs on a daily basis by promising to supply all our needs according to His riches in glory (Philippians 4:19).

Paul could identify with the psalmist, for he was surrounded by hundreds of hostile Jews who were bent on his destruction. Their plot to assassinate him seemed foolproof, except for the fact that Paul knew the Lord was the lifter of his head. In fact, God had already arranged for Paul's nephew to hear of the plan and to be taken to inform the commander of the army of the evil plot. The commander then intervened, and the plot was foiled (Acts 23:16, 23-24). 

There is a place of rest in the Lord where we do not fear the plots of the enemy. Instead, we lie down and sleep because the Lord sustains us (Psalm 3:5). We are encircled by God's protection, and Satan cannot enter that circle without God's permission. We can rest easy today under God's shield, for He will not allow the plots, devices, and arrows of the devil to remain inside our circle forever. 

Let us make David's prayer our own: \"Arise, O Lord! Rescue me, my God! Slap all my enemies in the face! Shatter the teeth of the wicked\" 

(v. 7). Whatever plot the enemy may have hatched, God has a mes-senger-perhaps a nephew-to foil it!

In Acts 24 Paul could not be swayed to offer a bribe to Governor Felix (v. 26). He kept his conscience clear before both God and man. Consequently, he was able to reason with Felix concerning \"righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come\" (v. 25). 

Our primary witness to the lost comes from who we are, not just what we say. Felix believed that any man could be bought for a price and that Paul's words would eventually yield to his lusts. He found in Paul, however, a man genuinely concerned about the governor's soul-a man who was totally unmoved by materialism. Paul had discovered that \"the Lord has set apart the godly for himself\" (Psalm 4:3). Because of Paul's integrity, nothing could penetrate his shield of protection. 

Be careful of your witness, as well as your words, in front of those you seek to influence. Satan will try to negate your witness by your works. One false move and all that you say will be meaningless. If you are going to preach about the judgment to come, live as though you are ready for the judgment. Then your witness will be powerful.

The prayer of Jabez is a cry for deliverance from a life of pain. The name Jabez means \"distress,\" or \"pain,\" and accordingly, from the day of his birth, Jabez endured much pain. 

Satan seeks to afflict those who are honorable with pain and sorrow in order to destroy their effectiveness. Jabez prayed for God to turn the devil's curse into blessing and his own limitations into enlargement. Our prayers, too, should be for God to enlarge our territory just as He did for Jabez, who had been through such pain and sorrow. We want to be enlarged, not for personal pride and pleasure, but to reach into the regions beyond with the Gospel. 

Jabez also prayed that God would keep him from harm so he could be delivered from a life of pain, sorrow, and distraction. And God granted his request! 

Why not pray today for God to reverse the curse and break the limitations you have faced, perhaps even from birth? He will spread His protection over you (Psalm 5:11) and surround you with favor as with a shield (v. 12)!

God helped the Reubenites, Gadites, and men of Manasseh when they waged war because they pleaded for His help in the midst of the battle. He answered their prayers \"because they trusted in him.\" 

In spiritual warfare you must remember two things. First, you need to pray constantly while the battle is raging. Assemble a group who will commit to pray continually until the battle turns and the victory is won. Second, remember that the Lord is fighting against the enemy (1 Chronicles 5:22). Recognize that it is really not your battle, but the Lord's. 

God and Satan are irreconcilable enemies, and God is as interested in your victory as you are. When you realize that God is actually fighting your battle, you will say to the enemy as David did to Goliath, \"The Lord does not need weapons to rescue his people. It is his battle, not ours. The Lord will give you to us!\" (1 Samuel 17:47). 

Many times you lose spiritual battles when you start complaining, whining, and muttering about your defeat. \"Those who love to talk will experience the consequences, for the tongue can kill or nourish life\" (Proverbs 18:21). Guard your tongue, and every day proclaim, \"The battle is the Lord's.\" He will not let you be defeated!

How easily we can be blown off course from the will of God by listening to advice from others instead of listening to a word from the Lord! Paul tried to convince the centurion that he had heard from God concerning great danger to the ship if they set sail from Fair Havens. Nevertheless, the centurion followed the advice of the pilot and the owner of the ship (Acts 27:11). 

Someone once said, \"We don't need good advice. We need a word from the Lord!\" God does not need decision makers-He needs hearers. In every circumstance, He has a planned way of escape (1 Corinthians 10:13), if we will take the time to listen to Him. The pilot and ship's owner thought they had made the right decision \"when a light wind began blowing from the south\" (Acts 27:13). How quickly, however, did the dreamy breeze turn into a nightmare storm! 

Do not try to discern the right direction with your natural mind, but wait upon the Lord and listen to His counsel. In the end, you will save yourself much heartache, for \"the Lord's purpose will prevail\" (Proverbs 19:21). If you follow His counsel, you will discover that God is your shield, \"saving those whose hearts are true and right\" (Psalm 7:10).

Purpose can make a huge difference in a person's life. The crew of Paul's ship had given up all hope of being saved (Acts 27:20) after being relentlessly tossed in a mighty storm for two weeks. Still Paul was not moved. He knew he had a purpose to fulfill, for an angel had spoken to him, telling him that he would \"surely stand trial before Caesar\" (v. 24). Believing that nothing could defeat what God had determined, Paul encouraged everyone around him that all would be well. 

When the circumstances of life fail to line up with your expectations, you can feel trapped, and the world becomes a hopeless place. God, however, has a plan for you, and when you find His purpose for your life, adverse circumstances become meaningless. No matter the difficulty, Satan cannot destroy you before you fulfill your purpose. 

In Acts 27:28, when all hope seemed gone, suddenly a slight change appeared: the depth of the water lessened. As you cling to your purpose and God's promise, suddenly the battle will begin to turn. It may seem almost imperceptible at first, but nothing will stop God from fulfilling His purposes. 

That's exactly what David experienced. After all the years of his trials with Saul, the day finally came when God removed Saul from the scene and \"turned his kingdom over to David son of Jesse\" (1 Chronicles 10:14). 

Keep sailing. God is not finished with you yet!

David's army was awesome. Some of his men were ambidextrous, so skilled and versatile that they could shoot arrows or sling stones with either hand. One was so powerful that he snatched a spear from an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall and killed him with his own spear (1 Chronicles 11:23). Others \"were expert with both shield and spear, as fierce as lions and as swift as deer on the mountains\" (12:8). 

The common thread running throughout David's army was courage. Not one was fearful, hesitant, or puny. All were talented, resolute, and aggressive. They worked with precision, totally destroying the enemies of God with an awesome unity of spirit. 

Paul, too, showed courage. He was so brave that he simply \"shook off the snake into the fire and was unharmed\" (Acts 28:5). The islanders kept waiting for him to collapse, but he just kept right on going. 

The day of weak and cowardly soldiers is over! The world is watching your courage in adversity. Quit taking your spiritual temperature all the time, and step into your mighty position in God. You are in His awesome army!

God wants you to \"break through\" in every difficult situation you face! David faced his first and greatest challenge from the Philistines immediately after he was anointed king. David asked God if he should go out and fight the Philistines, and God instructed him to attack, assuring David that He would give him the victory. Desiring to honor God for answering his prayers, David renamed the area of battle so that everyone who came there in the future would know of God's goodness to him in that place. It was known as the place of breakthrough. 

David referred to the battle in terms of the innate power that water has to break through any resistance. A flood of waters is an awesome force. It can break down dams, dikes, and walls, even moving rocks as it overwhelms everything in its path. Even more mighty is God's power, a force so great that it sweeps away any barrier the enemy tries to erect against us. 

Not only is God powerful in giving the breakthrough, but He is also strategic. In the second battle against the Philistines (1 Chronicles 14:14), God told David to encircle them and launch a surprise attack. David obeyed and broke through to victory again. Here we see that God is infinitely more powerful than the devil-and smarter! 

Wait upon God for His strategy, and move at His command. Believe today that His power and His wisdom will give you a breakthrough, for He is Lord of the Breakthrough!

Humanism tells us, \"I'm okay . . . you're okay\" and says that salvation is little more than a contribution to one's own personal happiness. As Christians, however, we know that without the salvation purchased by Jesus' blood, humanity is hopeless. 

Nowhere is the wickedness of humanity described in more graphic detail than in Romans 1 and Psalm 10. Paul begins Romans with a thorough description of the wickedness of humankind, coupled with a justification for the wrath of God. He continues with a description of how people have rejected the truth of God because of pride (Romans 1:21) and how such rejection has caused their minds to concoct unspeakable evils, such as idolatry and sodomy 

(v. 27). In Psalm 10:7, David describes the wickedness of people's motives and speech, which leads to abuses of power in their relationships with their fellow man. 

Before we can ever get people saved, we must get them lost. Who among us does not see within himself the awful fruits of rebellion these chapters describe? Let us thank God today that He is willing to forgive our past and to accept us as His very own children. We should be so grateful that we would never entertain the thought of turning our backs on Him.

God's kindness leads to repentance. We once were lost, irretrievable sinners, but when we realize that God still loves us enough to forgive us in Christ, it will break our wills and cause us to cry out to Him for mercy. 

David was so overwhelmed by God's kindness in promising to bless his future household that he exclaimed, \"Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far? And now, O God, in addition to everything else, you speak of giving me a lasting dynasty! You speak as though I were someone very great, O Lord God\" (1 Chronicles 17:16-17). Such honor and kindness from God made David a humble, not proud, man. 

Paul demolished the idea that God's goodness grants a person self-righteousness. The Jews he so often preached to felt this way when comparing themselves to the Gentiles (Romans 2). We must never fail to remember that we are no better than anyone else, and if not for the kindness of God, we would be just like everyone else! 

Be humbled today over the fact that, in His kindness, God has forgiven you. Never let that forgiveness be perverted into an attitude of superiority. Stay repentant and ever grateful that He has transformed your life. This continual gratitude and repentance will keep you from pride and religious arrogance from now until you see Him face-to-face!

David insisted on paying the full price for Araunah's threshing floor. The idea of making an offering to God with no personal sacrifice involved repulsed David. His God was entirely too holy and worthy to be offered a cheap sacrifice. 

Many Christians are looking for the \"bargain table,\" where they can serve the Lord with little or no personal change in their lifestyles or comfort levels. The Bible tells of many such people, who desired the environment of religion without the demonstration of true love for God or man. 

All love is shown by personal sacrifice. Jesus vividly portrayed His love for us by paying the full price for our sin. He took no shortcuts or easy roads to purchase our redemption. Willingly, He drank the full cup of God's wrath. He's asking us today, \"Have you resigned everything to Me and counted it as loss that you might gain Me? Are you willing to pay the full price?\" 

God takes seemingly insignificant sacrifices and uses them to build His mighty kingdom. David had no idea that his little seed of sacrifice at the threshing floor of Araunah would ultimately lead to the establishment of Solomon's temple at that very site (2 Chronicles 3:1). 

What have you offered to the Lord in loving sacrifice?

How proud and cocky are those who seek to oppress believers! Paul aptly describes their actions: \"Their talk is foul, like the stench from an open grave. Their speech is filled with lies. The poison of a deadly snake drips from their lips. Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness. They are quick to commit murder\" (Romans 3:13-15). 

Christians need not worry, however, for the boasting of such evildoers against the righteous incites the Lord to action: \"Now I will rise up. . . .\"(Psalm 12:5). God's remedy for persecuted, defeated believers is simply to supply them with the words of the Lord. God's Word is flawless, like \"silver refined in a furnace, purified seven times over\" (Psalm 12:6). 

In your battle, stop running to God to complain about your problem. Find His pure Word that He gave you to defeat your enemies, and rise up in victory over them. Others' advice may be helpful, but only the Word of God will put the devil to flight, as it is \"the sword of the Spirit\" (Ephesians 6:17). Employ the sword of God's Spirit, and watch your proud enemies flee in terror!

Heman's fourteen sons were given to him through the promises of God to honor him (1 Chronicles 25:5 NIV). The Bible records that Heman's children were the product of his faith in the promises of God. Heman received these gifts by believing that God would give him children and that they would be a blessing. These fourteen sons were all gifted in music, and their excellence served to honor their father (1 Chronicles 25:5-7). 

In the New Testament, we also see this same pattern of godly children that are a blessing to their parents. Philip had four virgin daughters who prophesied and whose ministry was a great reflection on Philip's family and life. His children, like Heman's, brought honor to their father's name. 

The children of the godly are a blessing (Psalm 37:26). They are a gift-not a curse! Our children have been given to us by the promises of God, and Satan cannot use their lives to bring us shame and dishonor. Secure in the promises of God, we should expect our children to honor us, not to embarrass us. 

Let us expect all our children to know and serve the Lord and to bring us great delight as they walk before Him with all their hearts!

When you are dealing with something as impossible as having a child at the age of one hundred, your faith must be rock-solid! Abraham faced the fact that his body was dead (Romans 4:19), but he did not allow that consideration to weaken his faith. He came to a point in which his beliefs did not waver and he was \"fully persuaded.\" 

When confronted with an impossibility, you must face the facts with the truth, which is embodied in the promises of God. As you spend time meditating on the promises of God, you will become \"fully persuaded.\" His promises will so saturate your mind and thinking that you will no longer waver in doubt when looking at outward circumstances. Rather, your heart will be convinced and remain fixed, regardless of what your mind thinks. Your heart will overflow with a faith that knows God has the power to do what He has promised. At that point, nothing the devil can do or say will move you from your position of faith. 

Keep reading, studying, and digging into God's promises. Persist in tearing down any area of unbelief, until you are \"fully persuaded.\"

Giving is based on motives, and in 1 Chronicles 29 David listed the right reasons for giving to God. First, he spoke about his own giving (vv. 2-3). Leaders have no business instructing others to give if they themselves have not given! 

Second, David challenged the leaders under him to give, and they responded willingly. Joyfully they provided an abundance of gold, silver, bronze, iron, and precious stones for the construction of the temple (vv. 7-8).  Because they had given freely and generously from their hearts, King David was filled with joy (v. 9). 

Third, David motivated the congregation to give. David reminded them in his prayer before them that everything comes from God (v. 14) and that they were only giving back to Him what He had given them in the first place. He then recalled the fact that they were only aliens passing through this world, using their earthly resources for a limited time called life (v. 15). 

Finally, David revealed that he had given with pure motives in the integrity of his heart, with no desire to impress or manipulate others 

(v. 17). That made his giving acceptable to God.

Why should we greedily grasp for the passing things of this life when they will only slip through our fingers on the day we enter eternity? If our giving follows the guidelines David laid out, the Kingdom of God will be financed properly, sacrificially, and abundantly!

At night, when our hearts are still, God speaks to us. To Solomon, God appeared with a fantastic question, one that we could only dream about someone asking us: \"What do you want? Ask, and I will give it to you!\" (2 Chronicles 1:7). 

Solomon's request should forever instruct us in what is truly important. Instead of asking for riches, long life, or the destruction of his enemies, his simple request was for more wisdom to care for the people of God. Anyone who puts the purposes of God and His people ahead of his own personal fortunes and fame will instantly win the favor of the Lord. 

\"And he will give you all you need from day to day if you live for him and make the Kingdom of God your primary concern\" (Matthew 6:33). Let us ask God for wisdom-not to make money or to control others, but to be able to administrate His kingdom with precision. When our hearts are separated from the world, God will give us the finances, physical health, and other things we need to help us accomplish our heart's desire for Him.

In music, sounds that blend together are called harmony, or symphony. If individual tones and instruments do not blend, they clash, producing cacophony. Imagine the awful noise if all the instruments in an orchestra played their own notes in completely different keys! But when all the instruments work together, the result is a beautiful piece of music that uplifts the human soul. 

God has called each of us, with our individual tones and ministries, to blend into one body. The result will be as it was at the dedication of Solomon's temple: a beautiful display of unity-not one individual note or instrument that clashes with others, but a conscious blending of our gifts and callings with that of others. 

Psalm 133:3 expresses it perfectly: \"Harmony is as refreshing as the dew from Mount Hermon that falls on the mountains of Zion. And the Lord has pronounced his blessing, even life forevermore\" (Psalm 133:3). Whatever calling, church, or ministry we are involved in, we must walk in unity with everyone else. Then we can watch the effectiveness of our ministry multiply and see the glory of God displayed for a listening world.

Solomon prayed that God's promises to his father David would come to pass. The King James Version says Solomon wanted God's promises verified. The word verify means \"to establish as a fact,\" or \"to prove true.\" Scientists verify their hypotheses by hundreds of tests. Detectives verify evidence by examining it from every conceivable angle. 

Faith means to believe God to establish His promise as a fact. You build your faith by searching out the promises of God until you have established, or verified, them as facts in your mind, not just as promises. When you establish God's Word as fact, He will then establish your life by fulfilling His promises: \"Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established\" (2 Chronicles 20:20 KJV). 

Whatever crisis you are facing, make the effort to verify the promises of God that pertain to that situation. Find every shred of biblical evidence that fits your case. Meditate on that evidence until it turns from a promise into an established fact in your heart. As you establish God's promises, He will establish you!

The Holy Spirit has come to dwell within us as the \"first installment of everything he will give us\" (2 Corinthians 1:22), or as the guarantee of our eternal inheritance (2 Corinthians 5:5). He is the \"down payment\" of our heavenly inheritance, where we will receive the full manifestation of our sonship and adoption (Romans 8:19). 

All that happens to us in this life is \"training for reigning,\" mere preparation for the time when we will rule and reign with Christ Jesus. The Holy Spirit within us is our Helper, the One preparing us to reign with Christ. When we encounter spiritual attacks, the Holy Spirit helps us to pray and overcome. Therefore, everything we are going through now is simply maturing us and preparing us for dominion in eternity. 

If we have identified with Christ's sufferings and fought life through, the eternal day will come when we will share His glory. We will be seated on thrones with Him. \"I will invite everyone who is victorious to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat with my Father on his throne\" (Revelation 3:21).

David recounts how God gave him overwhelming victory over any and every enemy that attacked him. He did not enter into agreements with his attackers-he defeated them! 

You must begin to see your spiritual enemies as they truly are- already defeated in Christ and subject to your spiritual authority. Make no compromises and take no prisoners! Be ruthless against every high thought that exalts itself above the knowledge of God (2 Corinthians 10:5), never wavering in your spiritual warfare against God's enemies. 

Paul states that in all these things you are more than a conqueror through Him who loved you (Romans 8:37). Declare with him, \"And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from his love. Death can't, and life can't. The angels can't, and the demons can't. Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, and even the powers of hell can't keep God's love away. Whether we are high above the sky or in the deepest ocean, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord\" (vv. 38-39). 

Go forward against your enemies, and don't stop until they have been crushed under your feet!

How sad it is to see a person move from having a tender heart and complete trust in God to having a cold, hard heart and an analytical mind that calculates every move. 

Unfortunately, that is just what happened to Asa.  He began his reign with a mighty victory, totally relying upon the Lord to defeat the Ethiopians. At the end of his reign, however, when he had grown old and was no longer childlike in his faith, he hired mercenary soldiers to fight his battles. The prophet rebuked him for his unbelief, reminding him that \"the eyes of the Lord search the whole earth in order to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him\" (2 Chronicles 16:9). 

Asa's unbelieving attitude was also evident in his latter years when he \"developed a serious foot disease. Even when the disease became life threatening, he did not seek the Lord's help but sought help only from his physicians. So he died in the forty-first year of his reign\" (2 Chronicles 16:12-13). How far Asa had strayed from the time when the whole nation sought the Lord and God gave him \"rest from his enemies\" (2 Chronicles 14:6)! He now focused his hope on the efforts of man rather than the power of God. Asa was not wrong to seek the help of physicians, but he did err in placing his trust in them rather than in the Lord. 

Let us purpose to stay simple, trusting, and childlike in total dependence upon God for all our days.

In this scripture, Paul reveals the connection between your mouth and your heart in the expression of your faith. Jesus said, \"For whatever is in your heart determines what you say\" (Matthew 12:34). Clearly, Jesus is the Word (John 1:1); therefore, when you speak the Word, you are speaking Jesus into your situation. 

Faith begins in the heart, a heart that is fully persuaded that the promises of God are true. Once such faith is deep within your heart, your mouth will begin to reflect that faith by the words you say. 

Whatever you believe in your heart about Jesus, you confess with your mouth. You believe that God raised Jesus from the dead, and you confess, \"Jesus is Lord.\" You believe that Jesus paid for your healing, and you confess, \"Jesus is my Healer.\" You believe that Jesus is your Provider, and you confess, \"Jesus is my Shepherd.\" 

If you call upon the name of the Lord in faith, you will receive that promise for salvation, blessing, healing, or deliverance. After you receive the promise, speak the Word and watch Jesus show up on the scene!

Jehoshaphat received a bad report! A negative report can knock you down, as illustrated through the bad report given by the ten spies in Moses' day. Your response to a bad report is critical, as it often determines the outcome of the situation. 

Jehoshaphat's response teaches several lessons. First, don't respond in fear, but in faith (2 Chronicles 20:3). Second, find a promise that fits your case and stand upon that promise, using it as the basis of your prayer (v. 9). Third, based upon that same promise, claim your inheritance and stand your ground, resisting all \"claim jumpers\" (v. 11). Fourth, turn the battle over to God (v. 15). Finally, praise God for the victory in advance (vv. 21-22). 

The world views a bad report as the definitive statement of fact regarding a matter. As a Christian, however, you know that you can reverse an evil report. Jehoshaphat's ordeal was transformed from the dreadful fear and alarm of the first report to the joyful, triumphal return to Jerusalem. 

The same battle plan that Jehoshaphat used will work for you. Fear not, find a promise, claim your inheritance, turn the battle over to God, and praise Him in advance. You will surely win!

All of us get \"out of joint\" occasionally-with our spouses, with the Church, with other people, and sometimes even with the Lord. We don't mean to be that way. We don't anticipate our actions or feelings, but we find ourselves in dissension with others to whom we really are connected. 

In speaking of the human body, Paul said, \"The whole body is fitted together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love\" (Ephesians 4:16). When we get out of joint with the rest of the Body of Christ, we no longer supply what others need, nor do we submit to the Head, who is Christ. We cause ourselves, as well as those to whom we are connected, much pain. 

The remedy? One who \"is overcome by some sin\" (Galatians 6:1) should be restored gently by those who are spiritual. Such a person is still part of the Body of Christ, and we need him. We must always remember to deal in the spirit of meekness with one who is out of joint, because our Lord Himself paid the price when His bones were all out of joint! 

Get back \"in joint\" with your spouse and Christian friends. Jesus is the \"Joint\" that joins you!

Amaziah learned the lesson of unquestioning obedience. He had already invested one hundred talents of silver to hire ungodly mercenary troops from Israel for help in the battle against Edom. Then the prophet instructed him to refuse any allies that were not on the Lord's side, even if they had already been paid. Amaziah faced a tough choice: to lose his investment and follow God, or keep his investment and be on his own. 

Losing a job, money, or investments is never as great a loss as that of losing the presence of God. Paul admonishes, \"Don't copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will know what God wants you to do, and you will know how good and pleasing and perfect his will really is\" (Romans 12:2). 

Life is full of tough decisions in which you must choose between God's will and apparent wealth, fame, or strength. In actuality, the Lord can give you much more than anything you sacrifice for Him (2 Chronicles 25:10). Never value any worldly thing more than you value being in the peace and rest of God. Choose God's way, for as Romans 8:31 promises, if God is for you, who can be against you?

We can almost always trace our successes and failures to our seeking of God. When we are humble and childlike, we sense our total dependence upon and hunger for God. Prayer becomes easy and natural because we are so dependent. When we become proud and self-sufficient, however, we stop praying and start acting. 

The Lord helped Uzziah \"wonderfully until he became very powerful. But when he had become powerful, he also became proud, which led to his downfall. . . .\" (2 Chronicles 26:15-16). Satan trapped Uzziah in the same snare that he himself had fallen into in eternity past. Pride had caused Satan to be cast out of heaven, and pride caused Uzziah to be cast out of the temple. As a result of his arrogant attitude and defiant spirit toward the priests of God, Uzziah developed terminal leprosy. If only he had remained childlike, humble, and dependent! 

Our prayer lives reveal our heart attitudes. Therefore, we need to keep seeking the Lord, even if our minds tell us we have \"made it.\" God may be checking out our dependence attitudes!

What should we do when two Christians' convictions differ and each person's heart is pure? Paul teaches us to defer to our convicted brother in order to avoid offending him. We are not to look down on a brother whose conscience bothers him in a certain area, even though our conscience does not bother us in that same area. Instead, we are to accept him whose faith is weak. 

Why should Christians or a church break fellowship with someone over things that are only earthly or temporal? We should major on what the Holy Spirit majors on: righteousness, peace, and joy (Romans 14:17). We must let our brother or sister follow his or her conscience, and we must follow ours without brazenly displaying our actions for the purpose of argument. The important thing is the person, not the issue in question. \"And if another Christian is distressed by what you eat, you are not acting in love if you eat it. Don't let your eating ruin someone for whom Christ died\" (v. 15). 

\"Those whose hands and hearts are pure\" (Psalm 24:5) are allowed to \"climb the mountain of the Lord\" (v. 4). One day in heaven, the temporal disagreements of earth will be forever settled, and Jesus will be the only thing that matters.

Jesus spent His life bearing the insults of those who insulted God. King Hezekiah's messengers received much the same reaction in the tribes of Israel when they presented the invitation to return to the Lord and celebrate Passover (2 Chronicles 30:10). 

To the backslidden Israelites, the archaic idea of a Passover in Jerusalem was absurd. The messengers sincerely tried to turn the Israelites' hearts back to God, but the results were the same in village after village: \"But most of the people just laughed at the messengers and made fun of them\" (v. 10). However, the Scripture records that \"some . . . humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem\" (v. 11). 

If we just want to please ourselves, we will not venture out into the stream of evangelism where our feelings may get hurt. The burden of evangelism, however, belongs to God, and if we love Him, we will be willing to \"bear the disgrace he bore\" (Hebrews 13:13). We must realize that we are simply messengers delivering an invitation that others can either accept or reject. If Jesus was reproached, so must we be. 

Rejoice if men ridicule you. You are bearing the insults of God!

Prayer is the key that overcomes the enemy in battle. Hezekiah prayed on two different occasions and thus overcame tremendous struggles. First, he and Isaiah prayed against the invasion by Sennacherib (2 Chronicles 32:20), and God sent His angel to completely destroy the enemy's army. Then, in a struggle for his life, Hezekiah sought God, and God healed him in answer to his prayer (v. 24).

Manasseh, too, experienced the power of prayer to change a difficult situation. While in a Babylonian jail, he prayed to the Lord, and God miraculously delivered him and restored him to power. What powerful illustrations of prayer and its ability to release God's deliverance these examples are! 

Paul understood this principle of prayer when he asked the Romans to struggle with him in prayer that he might be \"rescued from those in Judea who refuse to obey God\" (Romans 15:31). David voiced a similar prayer: \"Protect me! Rescue my life from them! Do not let me be disgraced, for I trust in you\" (Psalm 25:20). 

Your spiritual leaders need your prayers. Pray diligently today for them to be protected, fruitful, and refreshed. Your prayers may save their lives!

Besides being promised that you will ultimately crush Satan, you are promised it will happen soon. This word means \"quickly,\" \"in haste,\" \"speedily,\" or \"shortly.\" God will not leave believers fighting Satan forever, but \"will grant justice to them quickly!\" (Luke 18:8). 

Finally, the Holy Spirit describes the position in which Satan belongs: under your feet! Jesus told His disciples, \"I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy, and you can walk among snakes and scorpions and crush them. Nothing will injure you\" (Luke 10:19). 

Pursue the devil until he falls, and then crush him under your feet! Then you can boldly proclaim with the psalmist, \"I have taken a stand, and I will publicly praise the Lord\" (Psalm 26:12).

This is a promise of God's faithfulness to His own. All day-day in, day out, year in, and year out-God's faithfulness is great. Man, in his stubbornness and rebellion, may drift away from God, but through it all, \"He remains faithful\" (2 Timothy 2:13). 

No matter what difficulty life throws your way, God has promised to 

\"keep the temptation from becoming so strong that you can't stand up against it. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you will not give in to it\" (1 Corinthians 10:13). David was so convinced of the faithfulness of God that he could say, \"Though a mighty army surrounds me, my heart will know no fear. Even if they attack me, I remain confident\" (Psalm 27:3). 

On the other hand, God is faithful to execute His judgment upon those who reject Him even after He has repeatedly warned them to repent. Gradually, but surely, He tightens the screws of justice until the person repents or brings about his own destruction. 

As hard as it is to believe, some people actually do choose the path of destruction. In 2 Chronicles 36:13, we read that \"Zedekiah was a hard and stubborn man, refusing to turn to the Lord, the God of Israel.\" Following his example, the people of Israel grew more and more unfaithful, ignoring God's repeated warnings until finally \"the Lord's anger could no longer be restrained and there was no remedy\" (2 Chronicles 36:16). 

If life is uncertain right now, cling to the one certainty: God is faithful! You can be sure that \"He will keep you strong right up to the end\" (1 Corinthians 1:8).

How difficult it is for our flesh to sit and wait! This proverb implores us not to take matters of revenge into our own hands and say, \"I'll pay you back for this!\" God's pace of justice is far slower than ours. He is long-suffering and full of grace, while we, on the contrary, are quick to judge and swift to repay. 

David said, \"Wait patiently for the Lord. Be brave and courageous. Yes, wait patiently for the Lord\" (Psalm 27:14). Had Abram waited on the Lord for his miracle son, he would not have ventured into the fleshly union with Hagar (Genesis 16). The result of his impatience remains with us today in the ongoing problems in the Middle East. 

The two lessons we must learn in order to obtain a promise are faith and patience (Hebrews 6:12). A large part of faith is simply refusing to yield to the thought that God somehow will be late. Though he may have felt nervous on the outside, David stayed confident on the inside. He waited patiently for God to act and said, \"Yet I am confident that I will see the Lord's goodness while I am here in the land of the living\" (Psalm 27:13). 

You, too, will see the Lord's goodness if you learn to patiently wait upon Him in faith.

What a sight it must have been when the song of the Lord was again sung in Jerusalem for the first time in almost a century! Seventy years of captivity in cruel Babylon gave way to a restoration of praise and worship. With praise, thanksgiving, and shouting, the people of God jubilantly rejoiced, saying, \"He is so good! His faithful love for Israel endures forever!\" (Ezra 3:11). 

Even today God is restoring praise and worship to His Church. Ezra 3:13 tells us that \"the joyful shouting and weeping mingled together in a loud commotion that could be heard far in the distance.\" And so will our praise be heard by a lost world that is waiting for some sound of the joy of the Lord. 

Satan hates the praises of God, for they represent a regathered people, a determined people, and an evangelistic people. Also, some people will not understand our praise because the man without the Spirit does not understand those things that come from the Spirit of God (1 Corinthians 2:14). 

Praise releases the waiting hand of God. Decide today to stay in the \"praising crowd.\" After all, that is your destiny throughout all eternity!

Ezra and his companions labored to reconstruct the temple at Jerusalem. When their actions were brought to the attention of Darius the king, he approved the building project. Furthermore, he supplied all the necessary materials for construction, while the people provided the work.

God Himself has provided the foundation, the equipment, and the materials in His Son, Jesus Christ. You are God's fellow worker, laboring to build on this foundation the types of works that will stand the test of time and eternity. \"If the work survives the fire, that builder will receive a reward. But if the work is burned up, the builder will suffer great loss. The builders themselves will be saved, but like someone escaping through a wall of flames\" (vv. 14-15). 

Your work for God will become the most important thing to you the moment you stand before the judgment seat of Christ. If your work on earth was hasty, superficial, and self-exalting, it will be destroyed. If it was deep, rooted in love, and glorifying only Christ, it will last. 

This spiritual temple you are building is all that is worthy of your life's work, so give it your all. You will enjoy the rewards of your work for eternity.

Ezra realized that if he tolerated the intermarriage of Israelites with foreign women, eventually the holy seed would become extinct and the Messiah would never come (Ezra 9:2). Just as Ezra was appalled at the Israelites' terrible breach of God's law, Paul was equally horrified that sin had crept into the church at Corinth. He ordered the excommunication of the one who was in open, unrepentant sin so that the Body of Christ could participate in a pure Passover feast. 

Just a little bit of yeast will cause the dough to rise, and a little sin mixed into a church will cause it to be filled with the \"bread of wickedness and evil\" (1 Corinthians 5:8). We must separate ourselves from any so-called brother who continues to sin through immorality, greed, thievery, or idolatry. 

Separating ourselves from unrepentant sin benefits not only us but also the whole Church. The end result? The Church will be protected, and perhaps the offender will repent and be saved (1 Corinthians 5:5).

Your body is a temporary house that you occupy before moving into eternity. The body itself is not evil, only the sinful nature that manipulates it. Concerning the human body, Paul first taught the Corinthians that their bodies were \"actually parts of Christ\" (1 Corinthians 6:15). It would be unthinkable to take Christ's body and place it in an immoral situation! In the same way, you must consider your body as respectfully as you would Christ's own body. 

Second, Paul stated that the body is the \"temple of the Holy Spirit\" 

(v. 19). To use it in outward sin, therefore, obviously grieves Him. If you consider an earthly temple as holy, how much more should you respect a temple where the Holy Spirit is physically present! 

Finally, Paul says, \"You were bought at a price.\" Your body is worth the highest price ever paid for anything-the blood of Jesus. If God sets such a high price on your body, how much more should you cherish it! 

Value your body, and don't cheapen it with immorality. Refuse to yield it to the desires of the sinful nature. Keep it pure, and one day it will be glorified like Jesus' body.

Nehemiah found a waiting enemy in Sanballat. As soon as Sanballat heard about Nehemiah's intentions to rebuild Jerusalem, he and his cronies mocked and ridiculed Nehemiah (Nehemiah 4:1-3). 

Whenever you launch out for God in obedience to His Word, the devil will be right there to tell you how foolish you are to even consider such an idea. He points to those who have tried the same thing but failed. He questions your motives, accusing you of only wanting recognition. He laughs at you in hopes that you will never start, for he knows that when you are resolved to finish, \"the God of heaven will help [you] succeed\" (Nehemiah 2:20). 

For Nehemiah, when the battle was over and the wall rebuilt, he could say with David, \"Praise the Lord, for he has shown me his unfailing love. He kept me safe when my city was under attack\" (Psalm 31:21). 

Whatever you are doing for the Lord, \"be strong and take courage, all you who put your hope in the Lord\" (Psalm 31:24). Let the enemy ridicule, scorn, and mock, but God will have the last laugh!

Have you ever been in a pitched battle? Nehemiah was! As he neared the end of constructing the wall, he remained ever vigilant.  He never took off his armor in the day of battle and kept his weapon with him at all times. Relaxation was not an option. 

At times the spiritual warfare in life can reach a fever pitch. Satan knows when you are approaching a breakthrough threshold in the advancement of the Kingdom of Christ. But just like a sports team that fights hardest in a goal-line stand, you've got to hold steady and remain firm in the fiercest moment of battle. 

As Paul said, \"Use every piece of God's armor to resist the enemy in the time of evil, so that after the battle you will still be standing firm\" 

(Ephesians 6:13). When you are facing a crisis and engaged in spiritual warfare, don't stop battling the devil until the breakthrough comes. There will be plenty of time for rest when the battle is won!

Integrity is the missing ingredient in many leaders today. Nehemiah, however, taught and modeled a sacrificial lifestyle that was above reproach. Although he had a right to be pampered, he refused to place a heavy burden on the people (Nehemiah 5:15). Although others had lorded it over the people, Nehemiah devoted himself to the work on the wall (v. 16). In addition, he never demanded the fine food allotted to him as governor (v. 18). He was a man of rare integrity who led by his example. 

A life of integrity demands a lifestyle of accountability that involves one's money, priorities, and motives. God was so blessed by Job's integrity that He described him as \"the finest man in all the earth-a man of complete integrity\" (Job 2:3). In the New Testament, Peter reminded the elders not to be greedy for money, but eager to serve; not to lord it over those entrusted to them, but to be examples to the flock (1 Peter 5:2-3). 

Those you lead can tell if your heart is influenced by the work or the benefits of the work. If you aspire to leadership, seek integrity. God will be sure to make a place for you!

A sad Christian is no witness for God. Ezra read the Book of the Law to the Jewish remnant, and when they heard God's words, \"all the people chanted, Amen! Amen!' as they lifted their hands toward heaven. Then they bowed down and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground\" (Nehemiah 8:6). 

Why should church services and times of preaching be times of sadness and boredom? When the people wept after hearing God's words, Nehemiah told them, \"Go and celebrate with a feast of choice foods and sweet drinks, and share gifts of food with people who have nothing prepared\" (v. 10). The Israelites obeyed and celebrated \"with great joy because they had heard God's words and understood them\" 

(v. 12) 

Later that month, in celebrating a major festival that had been unobserved for many years, the people lived in booths for seven days, and \"everyone was filled with great joy\" (v. 17). Another observance followed, and this time for six hours at a time the Levites led in worship, saying, \"Stand up and praise the Lord your God, for he lives from everlasting to everlasting!\" Then they continued, \"Praise his glorious name! It is far greater than we can think or say\" (9:5). 

Why should Christians ever lose their joy? Someone has said that if the devil can't steal your joy, he can't spoil your goods. Even in your most difficult moments, look to eternity, where you will forever rejoice, world without end. Take a drink today from the joy of heaven, for it is your strength!

David tells us three things we must do to emerge victorious from troubles. First, he tells us to praise the Lord (Psalm 34:1). When we bless the Lord for all His benefits, boast in the Lord concerning His attributes, and exalt Him for His goodness, we are focusing on Him instead of our troubles. How easy it is, though, to let trouble take over our thinking to the point that we forget how great God is! 

Second, David tells us to seek the Lord (v. 4 KJV). To seek means \"to inquire diligently,\" or \"to reach a place of desperation.\" David knew this kind of desperate crying out to God and the results it brought: \"This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles\" (v. 6 KJV). Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, Moses stretched out his rod, Peter put on his sandals . . . and God delivered from sickness, danger, and imprisonment! 

Finally, David said to reverence the Lord (v. 9). We must examine every area of our lives to be certain our giving, our words, and our relationships are in order. In this way, we honor God. 

When we praise the Lord, seek the Lord, and reverence the Lord, we will be delivered from all our troubles!

So often when we walk through a crushing experience, we feel like God is a million miles away. The enemy tells us that God does not care and is not interested in our problems. David reminds us, however, that God is nearest to us when we are broken in heart. 

When the earth was dark and without form, the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters (Genesis 1:2). Never forget: Whenever your life seems dark and no solution is in sight, the Spirit of God is actually hovering over you, guarding you in the midst of trial. 

Someone once said, \"When you have a broken heart, you must give God the broken part.\" David gave God his broken heart in repentance after his sin with Bathsheba and reminded God that \"the sacrifice you want is a broken spirit. A broken and repentant heart, O God, you will not despise\" (Psalm 51:17). God responded by healing David's broken heart and restoring his soul. 

You must bring your broken heart to God and let Him heal it, for a \"broken spirit saps a person's strength\" (Proverbs 17:22). Go to Jesus with your broken heart, for He was anointed to \"comfort the brokenhearted\" (Isaiah 61:1). Why not reach out and ask the Holy Spirit to touch you where no human surgeon can? He is near. Let Him do His work right now.

How quickly the enemy tries to sneak back into areas we have removed him from in the past! In the first chapters of Nehemiah, we see a man named Tobiah causing Nehemiah great problems. Nehemiah defeated him, yet sometime later we find Tobiah living in the temple where the tithes and offerings were kept! 

We should never lose our vigilance in fighting the devil. If we relax after a victory, he will try to sneak in the back door and continue his wickedness. Peter instructed us to be on guard against the devil because \"he prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for some victim to devour\" (1 Peter 5:8). 

Any house left vacant gradually falls into ruin. When Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem, he found that the tithes had not been paid, and the duties of the priesthood had been neglected. In addition, the people had failed to keep the Sabbath and had even intermarried with the heathen (Nehemiah 13:9-25). 

Because Satan always returns to a house that is unoccupied even though cleansed (Matthew 12:44), we must guard our souls against his counterattacks. He is like a crocodile stalking its prey, probing for an opportunity to attack and waiting for the relaxation of vigilance. Let's stand our ground and watch carefully, throwing him out at the slightest sign of reentry!

Society's hatred for the Jews has always been extreme and inexplicable. The magnitude of their suffering defies reason. The fact remains, however, that Satan knew salvation (Jesus) would come from the Jews, and thus he sought at every turn to destroy the Jewish people. 

The Jews' worship of the true God and their rejection of idolatry led Mordecai to refuse to worship any human being (Esther 3:5). Haman's well-conceived plot looked foolproof, but God had been engineering a rescue operation about which Haman knew nothing. Working her way up to the right hand of the king was a little orphan (Esther), who would ultimately be the tool of deliverance in the hand of God. 

Satan is enraged by anyone who refuses to bow down and worship him, and he will do whatever he can to destroy such a person.  Satan's best plans, however, are no match for God, who knows the end from the beginning and the \"way out\" of the problem before the \"way in\" even existed! 

Stand still and wait on God, for He has known the solution to your problem since before it came into existence!

Paul shows us that we are a totally interrelated body, not just independent parts thrown together. No part of the human body can continue to function normally when one part is in pain. The whole body focuses its attention on the area afflicted. In the same way, Mordecai sent word to Esther not to think that just because she lived in the palace she would escape the sentence of death imposed on the Jews (Esther 4:13). If she did not help, she would be destroyed, too. 

Our influences and gifts are given to us by God to help others for \"such a time as this\" (Esther 4:14). Let us take inventory of the positions, finances, and grace of God in our lives and see whom those gifts were intended to help. If we keep them for ourselves and do not identify with those in need, we will cry for help one day and no one will respond.

In looking back on his long life, David could highlight five attitudes that helped him not to worry, or \"fret not,\" as the King James Version reads (Psalm 37:1). In common language, we might say \"sweat not\" because the original word used means \"to be under heat or pressure.\" When you are walking through a fiery trial, it is imperative that you learn how to \"fret\" or \"sweat\" not! 

The first thing you've got to do is \"trust in the Lord\" (v. 3), or have an inward confidence that God is going to bring you through to the other side. With a conviction in your heart that God is on your side and wants to do you good, you can face anything. 

Second, you must \"delight in the Lord\" (v. 4), or make the Lord \"delicious\" to you. Just as a son enjoys his father's company, so you must enjoy your heavenly Father's company. Are you truly delighted to spend time with Him, \"tasting\" of His goodness? 

Third, you must \"commit everything you do to the Lord\" (v. 5), or roll your problem onto Him, acknowledging Him as the only One who can carry your heavy burden. If you commit your problem to Him, you don't have the option of taking it back! It is too heavy for you; you cannot carry it in your own strength. 

Fourth, you must \"be still in the presence of the Lord\" (v. 7). This implies rest, not continually magnifying Satan's attack through your speech. 

Finally, you must \"wait patiently for Him to act\" (v. 7), keeping a constant sense of expectation that your miracle is right around the corner. It's never easy or pleasant to simply wait, but it is the key to seeing God move on your behalf. 

Trust, delight, commit, be still, and wait. Your fretting will disappear, and God will bring the victory!

How furious Satan was at Job, a man who was \"blameless, a man of complete integrity. He feared God and stayed away from evil\" (Job 1:1). Satan continually plotted, planned, and accused Job before God until God finally gave him permission to breach the protective hedge (vv. 10-12). 

How could God do such a thing? He had confidence that Job would continue to serve Him, regardless of circumstances, and that Job would prevail over the enemy. 

\"The wicked plot against the godly . . . but the Lord just laughs, for he sees their day of judgment coming\" (Psalm 37:12-13). How can God laugh when we are under such attack by the wicked? The Bible records that God laughs only when someone threatens Him: \"Let us break their chains,\" they cry, \"and free ourselves from this slavery.\" But the one who rules in heaven laughs. The Lord scoffs at them\" 

(Psalm 2:3-4). 

God has no problem with confidence, and He also has confidence in you, or He would not allow you to encounter trials. When you laugh at the enemy's attack, you are simply treating Satan the way God treats him. Pass on through your trial with the laughter of God in your mouth. He is not threatened, and neither should you be!

The local church exists for two reasons: the edification of the believer and the evangelization of the unbeliever. All the gifts of the Spirit are intended to edify, or build up, both the person who is releasing the gift and those who are receiving it. 

When we go to church, we should be thinking of what God has given us that day that we can share with the other believers. Do we have a song to sing, a testimony to share, money to give, or words of prophecy to speak? If we share our gifts in love, \"everyone will learn and be encouraged\" (1 Corinthians 14:31). And perhaps even more importantly, unbelievers present with us will be touched in their hearts and say, \"God is really here among you\" (v. 25). 

It is imperative that we, as members of the Body of Christ, understand our gifts and move in them in love. When we release the gifts of the Spirit that are within us, we grow in grace, other believers profit, and unbelievers repent.  

Which gift do you bring to your church?

The cry of man throughout the ages has been for someone who could act as an umpire in the game of life. Job envisioned a mediator who could be on equal terms with both God and man and could reconcile us to the Father. 

In Christ's resurrection, Paul presents a picture of the man Job was looking for. \"So you see, just as death came into the world through a man, Adam, now the resurrection from the dead has begun through another man, Christ\" (1 Corinthians 15:21). Only a \"God-man\" could come to earth, die for our sin, and be resurrected as the Son of God. 

Jesus, the second Adam, is the Umpire, the One who can stand between God and man to reconcile us. His resurrection has assured us that in the end, He will humble \"all his enemies beneath his feet\" (1 Corinthians 15:25). Let us look to Jesus as our Hope, both now and forever!

In an illustration of a tree stump, Job saw a revelation of the resurrection. He envisioned a decaying tree stump with old roots suddenly reviving at the \"scent of water\" (Job 14:9). Out of the apparent deadness came tender shoots. New life sprang forth from seeming death. 

Then Job asked the question of all ages: \"If mortals die, can they live again? This thought would give me hope, and through my struggle I would eagerly wait for release\" (v. 14). Job received the revelation that in death the physical body simply waits for its renewal to come. In the resurrection day, at the \"scent of water,\" our dead, lifeless bodies will be quickened by the power of the Holy Spirit and made immortal like Jesus. 

Need encouragement? \"So, my dear brothers and sisters, be strong and steady, always enthusiastic about the Lord's work, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless\" (1 Corinthians 15:58). The resurrection is coming!

Through all Job's struggles, two things brought him hope: there was Someone in heaven who would represent his cause, and even if he died, he would be resurrected. Job longed for an unseen intercessor, who would \"mediate between God and me, as a person mediates between friends\" (Job 16:21). John tells us that we do indeed have Someone to act as a mediator for us, and \"He is Jesus Christ, the one who pleases God completely\" (1 John 2:1). 

Through all the false accusations leveled by his \"friends,\" Job clung to one central thought: \"I know that my Redeemer lives, and that he will stand upon the earth at last\" (Job 19:25). That reality led him to a second conclusion: \"And after my body has decayed, yet in my body I will see God\" (Job 19:26). This is the clearest statement of Job's belief in the resurrection. He knew that even after his body was destroyed, he would see God in his own flesh. 

Hold to these two great truths for encouragement: Your Advocate is praying for you, and one day, in a glorified body just like His own, you will see Him face-to-face.

In his depression, David had obviously reached a point of such despair that he was sure his troubles numbered more than the hairs of his head. Paul was in a similar position in the battles he faced in Asia. 

\"I think you ought to know, dear brothers and sisters, about the trouble we went through in the province of Asia. We were crushed and completely overwhelmed, and we thought we would never live through it\" (2 Corinthians 1:8). 

Even in that kind of pressure, Paul found a secret that sustained him. He discovered God as the \"source of every mercy and the God who comforts us\" (2 Corinthians 1:3). When God comforts us and shows us His mercy, it has a double effect: we learn to rely more on Him, and others learn from our deliverance. We can never totally identify with others until we have walked their paths, and God will use our troubles to become a testimony to others in need. 

Lift up your head and let the God of all comfort minister to you right now. Then \"many will give thanks\" (2 Corinthians 1:11) to God on your behalf, and God will be glorified in it all.

David's words relate how important it is to know that your conscience is clear when you go through a trial. Satan, the accuser, is quick to send others to question your motives, character, and conduct. But even if all three areas are pure, you still can come under attack from the enemy. 

No amount of accusation from Job's friends could sway his conscience. He declared, \"I will never concede that you are right; until I die, I will defend my innocence. I will maintain my innocence without wavering. My conscience is clear for as long as I live\" (Job 27:5-6). 

Paul, also an object of accusation, wrote to the Corinthian church, \"We can say with confidence and a clear conscience that we have been honest and sincere in all our dealings. We have depended on God's grace, not on our own earthly wisdom. This is how we have acted toward everyone, and especially toward you\" (2 Corinthians 1:12). 

Of course, neither Job nor David nor Paul was claiming perfection, only godly sincerity of heart. Never let the devil slander your conscience if you have walked in integrity. A weak or wounded conscience will destroy you. Stand up to the accuser, and wait for the vindication of the Lord!

How easy it is in a trial to live life looking through the rearview mirror! Job could not help but remember the times of total peace and prosperity when nothing was wrong and he felt the continual presence of God. 

Such rear reflection is destructive, however, because it brings a deep sense of regret and remorse instead of hope for the future. The sons of Korah wrote, \"My heart is breaking as I remember how it used to be: I walked among the crowds of worshipers, leading a great procession to the house of God, singing for joy and giving thanks-it was the sound of a great celebration!\" (Psalm 42:4). The effect of such backward gazing is depression. \"Why am I discouraged? Why so sad?\" (v. 5).  

Paul learned to no longer look at the past but to consider the future as one long triumphal procession in Christ (2 Corinthians 2:14). You cannot relive the past-you can only walk with Jesus into the future. Put your past under His blood. Take His hand today and let that relationship give off the aroma of Christ to a watching, waiting world.

What a comfort it is to know that in our hour of darkness, the Lord will remember those things which we have done in secret for the poor and will reward us openly (Matthew 6:4)! 

Job rehearsed his heart for the poor as a statement of his genuine consistency before God. He looked at his servants as his equals because he believed that \"God created both me and my servants. He created us both\" (Job 31:15). He ministered to the needs of those less fortunate by helping widows and caring for the fatherless (v. 18).  

James said, \"Pure and lasting religion in the sight of God our Father means that we must care for orphans and widows in their troubles, and refuse to let the world corrupt us\" (James 1:27). David observed, \"Oh, the joys of those who are kind to the poor. The Lord rescues them in times of trouble\" (Psalm 41:1). 

Rather than seeing it as a burden, we must look upon helping someone in need as an opportunity from God to show love. Our concern for the less fortunate may one day be revisited upon us!

What a powerful witness it is to walk in the light! Paul actually states that a clean, pure walk with the Lord is what helps us to commend ourselves to others. The process is actually very simple. The Holy Spirit shines the light of Christ upon our lives, changing us \"from glory to glory\" (2 Corinthians 3:18 KJV). That unveiled glory is then reflected from our faces to a darkened, oppressed world whose eyes have been blinded by the \"god of this evil world\" (4:4). 

\"For God, who said, ‘Let there be light in the darkness,' has made us understand that this light is the brightness of the glory of God that is seen in the face of Jesus Christ\" (4:6). From within these \"perishable containers\" (v. 7) shines out the very glory of the Creator God who spoke a billion suns into existence in one moment! 

We are \"full of light from the Lord\" (Ephesians 5:8), and as we walk in the purity of Jesus' face, a lost world will behold Him. We walk through pressure, perplexity, and persecution with victory, so that the \"life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies\" (2 Corinthians 4:10). 

Our greatest witness? Our radiant shine!
